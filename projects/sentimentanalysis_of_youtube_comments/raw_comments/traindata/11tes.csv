Afno jyan bhanda pyaro tiktok? ️ bharey tyo video haru ley afulai samsya nalyaos and yesari post garna ley aru pani jhan influence hudai cha jasto lagcha malai chai. Ramro sanga bichar garera matra yesto kadham uthaum hola.,1
1,"This guy breaks down the cases like nobody else.
MVP and the dark horse of Nepalese media. ",1
2,"Man, this video gives goosebumps. Scary af. It is really really sad to see where our country has reached and how the citizens have to suffer this in the hope of better future.",1
3,"There are so many facets to this journey. I have not discussed less used routes and other intricate details of the journey. I would have loved to go even deeper but I tried to explain the situation from a top down view and as an entry point to the whole crisis rather than a full on explanation. Special thanks to all those who contacted us, helped us, talked with us on Zoom meetings and social media. And if you have other facts that we have missed, feel free to add those. See you in the comments. ",1
4,"As a nepalese doing buisness in both portugal and Croatia, sadly its true these so called agents are non other than our nepalese brothers, if your working in croatia and have a good job you can apply for visas for countries like portugal Spain but we choose these shortcut paths, there have been countless deaths but it never comes out. thankyou brother for spreading out the news I hope this video brings for kind of awareness to people coming to europe
fortunately for dharamdas he's recovered well and is working in airport thanks to some good nepalese brothers out there.",1
5,"Idk much about USA  but While i was working in Australia Detention centre hv meet 3 nepalis  middle age bro who reached to Australian land via similar way. They used  to say spent about 15/20 lakhs.  Hearing their story was frightening. They came nepal to delhi , Delhi  to Bangkok,  Bangkok to Jakarta,  Jakarta to Christmas island in Australia.  Boat ride from  Indonesia to Australia is absolutely death cheat. Its not safe , its dangerous, even tho if u ever reach to Australia or any other nation u will not grant a asylum. Be sure my nepali bro/sis plz dont try this way. It doesnt worth at all. Its risk of ur life 9/10. Especially for nepali  peeps close to impossible to get asylum coz we dont hv civil war in Nepal.  We nepali are safe in our countries.   Any of you will find impossible to proof ur refuge.  Any country will not grant you refugees just because  you get there.  U will be turn back after many years of court battle thats for sure . Those  went druing Maoists war in nepal yes  that time we had chances of getting  refugee statue coz its was unsafe to deport you back but now things has changed, nepal is safe there is nothing to run away from nepali getting into western countries illegally except its economical immigrants. I worked closely with Border force in Australia so i can share more more informative  info to those who want to get illegally in any countries but i will always say plz dont do. Every countires main Goal is how to kick illegal immigrants out of country. So plz dont every try to this journey.",1
6,You are doing great brother. I personally am so proud of you The level of research and hardwork you have put in every video is amazing ,1
7,"Congratulations Dipesh, I admire your videos. Thank you for making meaningful vlogs. At least you are doing something good for Nepali people.You are potential to become Nepali's Dhruv Rathee, and leave behind all the mainstream Nepali TV Chanels. Most of them are compromised and corrupted.  Please keep working.",1
8,"I have a similar incident of my own cousin. He went to study in Manchester, but couldn't focus on his study, his results were very poor so university didn't gave him letter or something like that. So, he escapes from UK went to Paris from there he took flight to Portugal and tear his passport. It's like 2 .5 years ago. Now he is living living life as hell. He cannot return to Nepal and working on minimum wages, still he doesn't get paid sometimes considering him as refugee or Indian origin by locals of Portugal. Nowadays it's a trend like students escaping from UK to European countries.",1
9,"Dipesh Brother, you're doing really a great task, please don't fred up and continue further. I am sure that your hardwork is going to pay off really well and will contribute in revealing the 'secret' dark-facts that rare people knows.. And also congrats for 90K+ subs, good luck for 100K very soon :)",1
10,"A day ago I was in Delhi for VFS appointment and I saw a lot of Nepalese waiting for their flights to Brasil, europe, And many other nations to get into US. I spoke with a few they informed me that they are willing to pay 45 lakhs for the trip which in real is totally illegal, insecure and that might cost them deportation or death.",1
11,Kudos to you Dipesh Ji! Thank you for letting us know the truth. Your videos are to the point and makes sense as what might have happened. Its an eye opener for many of us Nepalese. Looking forward to learn more from your videos.,1
12,Much respect to your hard work Your every single content is informative to us and just outstanding ,1
13,Thank you very much for this much needed video. It would be Intretesting to also talk about all the people involved in Nepal in taking the money of these people who are risking their lives  . People at every level are taking part in profiting in this human trafficking . You  missed  the tragic point about how many of them once they reach the destination are kept in rooms by the human traffickers until the family in Nepal pay the Lakhs owed. And how a many of them are used as black money mules !,1
14,"Really salute to this guy, his determination, research is very much useful to all of the Nepalese audience. I will say we should support such researcher.",1
15,"That is why Trump wanted to build a wall and go against illegal immigrants. What you have researched is basically human trafficking. Trump actually was against human trafficking. Many big businesses, esp food and agro businesses require labors. The only way they can get cheap labour's is through human trafficking. It all makes logical sense.",1
16,"Hats off to your content Sir️
Great research & amazing content",1
17,hats off to your work man ...its commendable to see your growth everyday,1
18,"Also, when I was in the US, I also met a guy who said he had visited 15 countries and spent over 12 lakhs (this was in 2008 ish) to get into America. At that time, it didn't make sense to me and I told him he wasted a lot of money doing so. A few years down the line I found out he was actually trafficked to America.",1
19,"Have been following u from the very starting of your journey and proud of it
Ur effort is unbelevable ",1
20,It is better to work in our own country rather than to take such life threatning trouble. Hope this video would be an eye opener for many people.,1
21,Quality content at it's peak,1
22,Bro Respect+ for your Quality content.. On point research and commitment for content ,1
23,It's kind of sad because we Nepalese think think that  Foreign country are like paradise. My father is also one of these people. He may have not crossed these roads but in hope of going to America we lost about 10 lakh through illegal agency. And we still haven't got our money back neither we are in America. It was before I was even born. And I feel bad for people who lost everything just for their family happiness. And government just don't look for them these is a shit no one talks or even care about.,1
24,"Thankyou for the awareness,may Nepali people get you and don’t risk their life.well if they don’t care about risking their life you guys can risk it for your own country and get well paid off for your task",1
25,Truth is hard  please don’t travel illegally ,1
26,After hearing this I think this video will saved many life of our nepali people's who wants to migrate in future for better way of living life but there is no guarantee they will reach or not to the place so this video will help them to change their mind so don't do any risky thing's with your life,1
27,This is what quality content means.,1
28,"I met 4 Nepali in US, who who arrived here via the route mentioned in video. Their story is very frightening. All of them said they were robbed and have given 50-60 lakhs to agent in Nepal. 

I would request nobody to come illegally. There very little chance you will enter US alive. One person was telling me, out of 39 people only 13 entered us rest died on the way. ",1
29,"dai i just respect your intelligence and your commitment on research!
i want to spend 15 minutes on a table talk while i come back to Nepal!
i will try my best to make it possible!Hats off!Keep up the good work and!
Best Regards

यो कुरा भोग्नै लाई थाह छ कि वास्तविक यात्रा कस्तो हुन्छ भनेर। विभिन्न कथा सुनेको छु यात्रा क्रममा ' बलात्कार, लुटपाट, अपहरण र फिरौती, बिचल्ली, मानसिक तनाव' जति सुने दर्दनाक थियो। घर समाजले तिरस्कार हुने डरले मात्र यस्तो घटना बाहिर न्आएको  हो।",1

54,"Could you also shed some light on the mass exodus of skilled manpower, like doctors, engineers, nurses, etc. ? Also how the Nepal government is willingly propagating this exodus of youth abroad, just so they can get a taste of that ""remittance tax"".. 
 
P.S. Nepal is going to face a huge shortage of doctors and nurses in the coming 5-8 years. Even, reputed and established doctors are flocking abroad..... all the while, the policy makers do nothing to encourage the retention of this skilled man-power... Sahujis and influential doctors are themselves the policy makers and make policies that helps them gain their personal benefits....",1

104,"You forgot to mention the very important fact that you might die on the fuel tank on your way to USA. And if you don't, you will likely witness a death along the way somewhere. Then, after you reach USA, you have to hire a lawyer for almost every further processing and pay them. Sure, government provides them a lawyer if they don't have one. In their mind though, they think Nepalese lawyer will do everything to win their case instead of free lawyers. So, they pay upto $10000 for the entirety of their case. In some cases, it can take more than 10 years to get the asylum. And just because you share nationality with your lawyer doesn't mean they  work so hard for u to not get deported. After all, it's the fee they work for not you. Everyone is a vulture here. I know because I am one of them.",1

199,People are saying that oh so risky don’t try to do that it will harm you stay in Nepal and do something fuck you the deep reality is that even if you work in Nepal 14 hours a day you will get only 10k salary and a lot of mental stress. the politics and the owners and other people don’t give a fuck. Your society always compare you with them who went to aboard that’s the reality and that’s the truth. If you want to know how they treat you to check the airport security if your going to aus usa uk or Europe country they will treat you differently then gulf country. If you stay in Nepal for too long boi the low income people either start to steal or they will suicide. And this is reality,1
