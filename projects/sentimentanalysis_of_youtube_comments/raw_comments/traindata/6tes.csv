0,The main reason for downfall/situation of Government school is the politics inside them. There is extreme groupism and unions creating chaos in its functioning.,1
1,"I was in private school, we were forced to study hard to get marks... we were often humilated and bullied ..they did not teach us to get knowledge or be good humans, they teach us how to get marks in SLC exam so that repulation of school will be good. There are so many things but I feel uncomfortable to share in public... ..",1
2,"The education system of Nepal had bugged me for a very long time, great content. 

I think you should also open a Patreon type ko page to accept support/donation from your viewers that way you won't have to rely on sponsors. 

The reason I say is hunata I hope you'll only accept true companies as sponsors but just lack of funding ley garda jpt kura sponsor garna naparos bhanera.",1
3,"Me and my friend back in days paid Rs 500 per month for class 10. Now his son studies in primary and pays Rs 60000+ per month, yes he can afford but its not about affordability its about branding or mute bragging. Just like carring Hermes or Chanel bags, paying only for logo. 
Only solution is stepping up the level of government schools which seems highly unlikely looking at the trend of nepali politcs. 
Keep up making contents brother ",1
4,"As a young private school teacher, I have always not understood the way the whole education system of either private or government run schools. There was this one student who suddenly said, "" See, we are buying education."" while I was distributing the bills in the classroom. I was left speechless. Unlike those who go to abroad for further education, I've chosen to become a teacher and I'm pursuing this career with loyalty and diligence. I come from a government school and I know there is students in rural areas of Nepal who really, genuinely need good teachers. I am still woking on becoming the best at what I'm doing. At the same time, I hope there will be better policies and system regarding the education by those in power and authority. Just imagine, how amazing it would be if only the education sector in Nepal was just practical!",1
5,Yes yes yes this is one of the most needed topic to be talked about. Kudos to you dai for bringing this up. Private schools aren't what we see. There is high level of black money invested. Te**rism money invested. Appreciation to this team,1
6,Quality contents to the point! And I think the root problem is corruption where private expensive and luxury school owners and shareholders do anything to degrage government schools! Education and health instituions are doing bloody business here,1
7,"Awareness is the first step to change. Thanks for the good content. 
Those parents who can afford, it's a subject of pride to them. Just to satisfy their ego and maintain their social position typically every layer of society does that. The vulnerable ones are the low income families who can't find affordable good education institutions. How can it be solved? What Parents and Students can do? It's not like committees for change weren't formed or they haven't tried.  How can it be changed? Who can change ? Unless the Governing Bodies are out of influence of national politics, greedy business minded individuals and have dedicated individuals for betterment of education, academic institutions will continue to stress parents (It's easy to say and everybody knows it).  Are there any ways to change the Education System without involving government sold out to corruption and greed?  Share your practical opinion please.",1
8,"This video, while it is only etching on the surface of the problems with education in Nepal, got me wondering about a lot of things. As an educator myself, I have always been focused on the issues Nepali schools, public and private alike, have had in terms of what is the purpose of education after all, but this video was a good reflection of the businessworld of schooling. Something that haunts me about prominent private schools in Nepal is their connections with some of Nepal's big political leaders and their vested interests that keep public education from improving.",1
9,"Very well researched video I'm glad someone made a video regarding it, this is also one of the biggest factors why people tend to move to abroad, it cost more money to raise a kid here than  in first world countries, how will a normal individual raise a child here let alone provide good education(where public schools are not upto the level) with wage rate of this country, this education institution  is a business as a whole...especially in college level they don't promote their institution on the basis of what education what subjects what degree they provide but rather it's how much fun they can provide their students, the lifestyle and such which means fuck all compared to what the main goal the education institution should stand for.",1
10,"Your research is an eye opener. I really appreciate your dedication and hard work that you put on in collecting information.  
I think, Out of many countless factors, Corruption followed by greed, poor judicial system and absence of control mechanism are  prime factors for deteriorating the education system.",1
11,"Hats off bro!! Banger content. Most people don't realize this tara dherai nai serious issue ho yo jasto lagchha malai. Dherai family haru ko lagi aafno children ko lagi quality education dina untenable nai hune awastha aaisakyo. It's only getting worse from here. Big salute to you for bringing this issue to light, and for a very well researched and presented video.
On another note, I have a topic suggestion. You could do one on our traffic problem, lack of quality public transportation system, and the cartels/syndicates that run the so called 'public buses'.",1

Still, there are lots of things that you guys have to do in this field. So, if possible, try to deliver content quickly.
My suggestion for the next video project is Inflation in Nepal as a result of policy and overall problems (beyond this INR 10 buying NRS 20 ""crazy double?"") and some solutions.

17,This video is awesome and I wish more people in the policy making level care to think this way. One more thing is that I think we will not have teachers who will be willing to teach in coming future.,1
18,You should also make video on colleges providing bachelor degrees affiliated to foreign university. Their average fee is around 10 to 15 lakhs.,1

20,"Since you have dig this deep ( Kudos to you ), let's dig deeper and find schools that are actually providing real education without ripping off parents' pocket. 

If any of the viewers of this great content have encountered these gems like schools then please mention.",1
21,"Thank you for bringing this up! This is one of the biggest issue Nepal is facing along with health.
I remember the early years of KP Oli's second tenure. He tried to abolish two cartels. First the transportation syndicate, which he did. Second, the education syndicate. He had his minister create a report and it did come. But Oli couldn't move ahead with it. The pressure from inside his party was so strong he had to change the education minister. Another good thing he did early on, stopping the ""kitta kat"" of agricultural land. Which again got repelled after he was weakened from within. In all this, I'm not saying Oli is great but these decisions were. But even such a character couldn't stand the pressure it invited. So, how do we as citizens change it?",1
22,Been working for education of rural side chidren since last 2 years. From my recent experinece I can guarantee there’s huge difference in terms of resources and exposure. Some government schools do have resources but no exposure in such way there will be huge difference in upcoming days. We are working on a project named Gyan! Lets work together to come up with a solution!,1
23,"Comparing  most of the private school with our school .It is completely different. It has most of the facilities that anyone can  access like  science lab ,computer lab and many more with humble and friendly teachers and education system is also good .This makes me soo happy and more motivated.",1
24,Thank you brother for this incentive about         showing the harsh reality of Nepal. Appreciate people like u who r endeavoring in helping to make a better Nepal. Thank You,1
25,After this vid my view upon schooling has changed ...I am preparing for medical entrance n all the quotas are provided to gov schooled children mostly so i was so mad about it but this video changed my opinion towards that facility to gov students...I hope one day we all Nepalese get to have equal n good quality education,1
26,"I visited most of the popular +2 college this year. I asked them, ""Why should I enroll my sister/brother to this college?"". They directly replied don't enroll here. We have a lots of students.",1
27,"Thank you for the good content always. Please do a video on MBBS, MD and the overall medical mafia in nepal as well. the shitty expensive price, the shitty exam process for residency , the low number of jobs etc",1
28,I did my schooling in the 80s and early 90s (1992 SLC) and in one of the most expensive boarding school at that time. My hostel fee was exactly 1010 and school fees ( including all other additional charges) around 600 while i was in class 10 .. Now the same school charges around 30-40 thousand for the same.. More than lakh to be paid during new admission..,1
29,This is the first video I'm watching made by you and I must say the quality of the video and the research that has been done is top notch! Great topic as well sir ,1
30,"Not only private schools , even some public schools are charging more monthly fee than the one allocated by the government by giving BS reasons. Sad reality of education in Nepal, hope to see it fixed one day.",1
31,"Brother, you do the best research that I have seen, especially in Nepal's context whether gathering the data for information is hard.",1
32,"One thing that I learnt from my father is that government does not allow opening and registration of new schools. That kind of policy has led to hyper-inflated valuation of these schools. No new player can open up a new school with low tution and high quality. Any new disrupter needs to buy an existing school at very high valuation which ultimately leads them to charge high price from students.

As always, most of the syndication problem in Nepal arises from bad policies of the Nepal government. Same thing happens in transportation sector too where new public vehicles cant easily get the black-plate license from the government (they need to buy existing black-plate license at a high cost in black market).",1
33,good video on an important issue. although i expected more on the cartel nature of private schools and how they exert political pressure for policy favors. a part 2 with specific ways pabson /npabson influence the education sector for their pockets using cartel-esque tactics would be very good. thank you,1
34,For your information i had completed my SEE from a private school but when i started studying 11/12 science from a government college I was shocked by its facilities and teachers  even though it's class 1-10 way way better than my private school.  So public school improves very much. Our public school have smart board computer lab science lab physic chemistry biology library and wifi all around with large play ground. I wiss i knew when i was in class 7 i would study there . And there is English medium too,1
35,Amazing video brother. Privat schools are the Biggest Cartel in Nepal. For any country to develop the most important thing is for it's people to be educated. Education is the most basic and most essential for any countries development. Nepal Government should end private school cartel and offer free education to it's people.,1
36,this entire video is a piece of art hats off to the team for puting so much effort to create this piece of art,1
37,"When I think of this topic, I am always disturbed. I can clearly tell that an average earning parents are not able to afford the fees of the schools. So they have to search for another form of income. The people who cannot they are using under the table (ghus) option and that's directly affecting all of us. Some of my friends are thinking of going abroad for the sake of their children. Most common answer is ""Nepal ma bacha ko padhai afford garnai garo cha. Bachalai hurkauna ni garo cha. Baru aile loan liyera bhaye ni abroad settle vayo bhane bacha lai padauna ra uniharuko future secure ta huncha hola.""  If the quality of education in government school is good then I will happily send my child to that school. Further guidance, I can give myself. I just hope that the government will do something, but I am sure that they will do nothing. ",1
38,This issue is serious.. Amazingly explained Dipesh brother… ,1
39,"I wish oneday nepal gona have minister  like arvind kejariwal, who made great changes in delhi. He develop gov school so much tht nowadays peoples were so eager to registrate their kids in gov school & its being so competative. 
Thnx for essential content bro.. 
good luck for more",1
40,The fees which private schools get from  people is not only for the school but  nearly half a percentage of that money is paid to the government officials who are directly or indirectly involved in the education department. All government schools in our country are not maintained properly by the government official mainly because all of them are involved in connection with private school authorities.,1
41,"You took out really an important issue sir....and whatever data you have presented is the real scenario i.e, happening currently in educational sector of Nepal and not solely school but the whole educational sector is being corrupted and mafiyas are roaming around there....We everyone are suffering here students, parents,
 teachers, staffs but except for the owner/ management of that particular school/college. This should be stopped as soon as possible otherwise people could hardly afford for formal education which is the topmost priority for developing our country.....",1
42,"I'm gonna be honest. I've learnt more from YouTube,Google than from school and I've learnt that expensive isn't the best from the fact that I was born in Nepal as an poor person.",1
43,So excited seeing Nepali content creators getting sponsors ,1
44,"Good analysis and bitter truth, The case should indiclude some schools which are delivering quality education in minimum fee in a standard environment. In Butwal, Kalika Manavgyan, Nabin Audhyog, Kanti Ma Vi, Shanti Namuna, these government schools are providing quality education in minimum fee. These schools not only provide education but also change the perception of the lower and middle class people towards the government school. In butwal the number of students in government schools have more than students studying in private school.",1
45,"This is a very concerning and terrifying topic many have ignored in nepal.

Tho there are facilities in private schools, the school tries it's best to leech out money from students. The reason for government schools to be this bad is just because it was neglected, dominated and prejudged.",1
46,Kudos to your research. Been following your videos and they have amazing data and facts. Thanks for sharing another burning issue of Nepal,1
47,"great video sir, you are Dhruv Rathee for us. thank you so much, keep making such awesome informative videos. ",1
48,"I am really suprised by these school fees my monthly school fees was 3750 Rs excluding Coaching encluding Coaching it was probably was about 8-9k and this was for class 10 from the month of Mangshir and this was a year ago and believe me when I say our school time was from 6 in the morning to 8 in the evening. Currently I am studying A levels not naming the college (owned by a politician) and my tuition fee for 2 years excluding British coucil exam fee is 3 Lakh which is honestly cheaper than most of these schools and +2 here is 1.5 Lakh for 2 years. So, people who are sending their kids to these kinds of school are either filthy rich or are simply getting scammed cause there are plenty of schools whose fees are 4-5k a month which in my opinion is preety affordable for a middle class household. For more poorer families government schools are the best alternatives and we know how these schools are and how they are runned.

49,I feel so good that creators like you are creating such good contents. lots of love and support keep going..,1
50,Yess! This is the thing I was looking for . I knew the education system is in a vital positive but I didn't knew it was so grave .,1
51,Why I feel like this channel resembles to the algorithm followed by random Nepali dai  gives me nostalgia looking someone like you getting more in depth towards the research for the well-being of our people keep doing it ,1
52,I studied in private school from class nursery to 8th then i was transferred to government school in 9th to 12th it was cheaper but the facilities was also the same even better also . the private school i studied was  missing some facilities such as chemistry lab and physics lab . The government school has it all and everything inside the lab can be used by every single student at the same time u know what I mean? .,1
53,This is to the point. I have been leading the medical college protest from years now. The same situation is in medical field as well. THe reason being same people also regulate medical sectors with the same business policy and is backed by the same political figures. This is exploiting the workers and over charging the students. The cumulative effect of which is only the handful people are getting the most out of the economy while the rest are getting poorer day by day. We have to end the cycle somehow.,1

60,Govt schools have the most qualified teachers but they are not delevering their best because of lack of motivation and poor facilities . Govt should make the govt schools better,1
61,! Excellent and on point content. Our education system has been in a dire situation for a long time. Even prime minister deuba's wife is running expensive school for profit like a company that too without the obligation of paying hefty tax on the profit. School should be a run like a charity but powerful people are running it like business. Very shameful for a nation like ours.,1
62,"Out of two very well known schools in Kathmandu, one school  in particular has been purely working as a 'cartel' as the creator mentioned. Both of these schools is run by two sisters. The 'one school' which is at Tilganga is known for its harsh implications on parents by forcing them to pay huge lump of money as tuition fees before the 10th of a month. Also 90% guardians aren't positive and optimistic about the school administration and are willing to form a union and revolt against it but it is doomed to fail because the school- as mentioned is run by one of the most prolific personalities known to merciless extort money as fees from guardians. They openly bost about their strong political support and are immune to any form of resistance. Mind you the school has become news for couple of times after which it had literally started keeping bouncers outside its gates and reception every now and then to plummet parents who spoke against the administration's brutal policy with regards to exorbitant fees.

I feel so sorry that i along with my family feel into the same ill mentality of public schools becoming less productive than private. Thanks again nepali comment!!",1

Thank you brother",1
123,The education in government school is good but students who study in government school can't give their 100% in their studies because of financial condition and they have to work and earn during their student life. So free education with quality should be assured for everyone. And beside that the  schools in rural areas should be merged if the number of students is low. We should know that teachers in government school are more qualified than that of private school.And the qualifications of teacher is not a problem. So for the betterment of government school student's quality of life should be uplifted.,1

168,"The whole education system needs paradigm shift. Unfortunately parents and schools are both complicit of this crime. Books after books, homework after homeworks; in between kids lose precious time to either be creative or follow their passion. Kids lose precious time doing homeworks and not getting enough time to spend with their parents. This leads kids to socially distance themselves from the parents but rather spend more time outside doing things that contributes to their personal development. Doing drugs and spending more time on the net brings in further distancing in the relationship between kids and parents. And ultimately breaks down to harmonious relationship. Dr yogi vikashanada of manokranti centre explains beautifully why Nepal's education system should adopt the model of Finland which lead to ultimately grooming kids who can tackle challenges of 21st century and beyond. We need to create people with better morals and ethics, so that we can have better statesmen and policymakers to transfer better deliver of services to ordinary citizens, where corruption is eradicated for good. But the current education system has systemically perpetuated greed and nepotism, and hold back people who are better at their respective jobs. I could write a book long comment but enough said. I just everyone to take a look at yogi vikashanada, he is truly a great being who can guide Nepal to positive direction.",1

My private schools (primary and secondary ) came to some sort of compromise, agreement, arrangement-whatever you want to call it-with the respective host schools (examination center) in SLC (SEE) and intermediate level (+2) to loosen up the strictness so that the students could freely discuss and copy each other's answers during examination session.

Literature review on USA 
A Review of the Empirical Research on Private School Choice

Parents in the United States have had the legal right to choose the school their child attends for a long time. Traditionally, parental school choice took the form of families moving to a neighborhood with good public schools or self-financing private schooling. Contemporary education policies allow parents in many areas to choose from among public schools in neighboring districts, public magnet schools, public charter schools, private schools through the use of a voucher or tax-credit scholarship, virtual schools, or even homeschooling. The newest form of school choice is education savings accounts (ESAs), which make a portion of the funds that a state spends on children in public schools available to their parents in spending accounts that they can use to customize their children's education. Opponents claim that expanding private school choice yields no additional benefits to participants and generates significant harms to the students “left behind” in traditional public schools. A review of the empirical research on private school choice finds evidence that private school choice delivers some benefits to participating students—particularly in the area of educational attainment—and tends to help, albeit to a limited degree, the achievement of students who remain in public schools.

Meta analysis On USA 

A Meta-Analysis of the Literature on the Effect
of Charter Schools on Student Achievement

A meta-analysis is performed of the literature on charter schools and achievement, with a focus
on lottery-based studies and rigorous value-added studies. Overall, for the limited set of charter
schools, locations, and years that have been studied to date, charter schools are producing higher
achievement gains in math relative to traditional public schools in most grade groupings. No
significant differences emerge for reading achievement. However for both math and reading, the
bulk of estimates are positive. For math, middle school studies tend to produce higher effect
sizes than other grade groupings. For math, studies that use lotteries or propensity score
matching tend to find higher effects than other methods. There is not a statistically significant
link between the years covered by a study and the estimated effect size, but for both math and
reading the trend is positive. A tiny but growing literature on nonachievement outcomes suggests
positive influences of charter schools on educational attainment and behavioral outcomes. 


Chile 

The quality gap in Chile’s
education system

Meta analysis 
Abstract: 
The quality gap in education between Chilean schools with
different administrative structures (especially in the case of municipal
schools and private subsidized schools) has long been a subject of
analysis and discussion within the wider debate surrounding the relative
efficiency and role of public education. Unconditioned differences in
the results of standardized tests that point to higher levels of quality in
private schools diminish when sociodemographic factors are controlled
for, but the question as to what control variables should be used and
which methodology is the most appropriate, as well as the extent of the
reduction, all continue to be a subject of debate. Here we undertake
a meta-analysis of 17 of the main studies that have been done on the
subject. The analysis shows how sensitive the results are to the controls
and estimation methods that are used. In the aggregate, private subsidized
schools score approximately four points higher than municipal schools do.
This is a statistically significant and educationally relevant differential


India 

Meta-Study of Literature on
Budget Private Schools in
India

Conclusion
The role of private schools in India’s education sector has been mostly undermined because of
the large number of unrecognised schools which continue to cater to low-income communities
in the absence of credible state-run schools in different parts of the country. The learning
outcomes of students from private schools, according to different studies, are either at par or
better than the learning outcomes of students from government schools. The major takeaways
from review of existing literature on BPS are:

Data used for education planning suffers from the gap of exaggeration of government
school enrollment and underreporting of unrecognized private school enrollment
(based on incompatibility of NSSO data and government-published education data.
o 95% of increase in enrollment in primary schools was absorbed by private schools, but
half of them are unrecognized and therefore not part of the reported statistics.
o There are supply side constraints in education, in terms of quality of government-run
schools and access to these schools which has led to an increased private school
enrollment despite regulation that is not favourable for investing in education.
o Regulations for private schools on paper are not consistent with market principles but
demand from parents has resulted in extra-legal regulations in practice which lack
stability but somehow continue to provide outcomes at par with, if not better than,
government schools.
o Study of 918 schools in the slums of Hyderabad reports mean test scores for
mathematics was 22% more and 23% more for students in recognized and
Meta-Study on BPS Literature | Centre for Civil Society | www.ccs.in Page 22
unrecognized private schools compared to government schools, achieved at between
half and quarter of teacher salary paid at government schools.
o Lower teacher salaries, lower PTR and less multi-grade teaching in BPS but BPS achieve
better learning outcomes than government schools or at par with them at 1/3rd of the
spending involved.
o Starting English instruction earlier and more active teachers are primary reasons for
parental choice veering towards private schools.
o BPS teachers are 2 to 8 % less likely to be absent and 6 to 9% more likely to be engaged
in teaching compared to government schools.
o While overall gains for children in private schools are modest (1/4th to 1/3rd SD), the
gains for students from lower economic strata are higher than those for students from
upper income groups.
o Different studies conclude that parents make decisions based on what little information
they do have about local schools but there is clear information assymmetry which
necessitates a scientific rating system for schools that all parents can have access to.
o Hostility in policy circles towards private education in general, because it is thought to
undermine the effectiveness of the state but Section 12 of the Right to Education Act of
2009 (RTE) illustrates that the state has started ceding the importance of private schools
in the education ecosystem.
o School choice program in AP show no significant difference in test scores of lottery
winners in Telugu and Math. But private schools spent 40% less instructional time on
Telugu and 32% less in Math resulting in higher average test scores across all subjects
for lottery winners. (0.13 sig higher)
o The issues raised about the viability of budget private schools as a major part of the
education sector are mostly related to equity and partly to the pedagogy employed.
Considering that these budget private schools are still inaccessible to the poorest of the
poor, the equity argument does hold some credibility. However, this would be true only
in a scenario where no government-run schools exist. Thus, like some papers suggest, it
may not be in our best interest to pick one or the other at the moment and instead, we
should be looking at a system where both co-exist and compete.
Meta-Study on BPS Literature | Centre for Civil Society | www.ccs.in Page 23
o It is important not to restrict the freedom of choice for those who can afford to pay for
their children’s education while making sure that even the children whose parents
cannot afford to pay, have access to some form of education.
o This model needs to be urgently considered primarily because of the costs involved. The
monthly fee charged by these budget private schools are much less than the per-child
expenditure per month incurred by the government and they deliver the same or better
learning outcomes.
o Therefore, if more of the government funding can be directed towards the poorest of
the poor who cannot access these private schools, it would be a much more efficient
financial model which subsidises only the people in desperate need of it and at the
same time provides more choice in terms of schooling for parents.
o Thus, the role of BPS in education needs to be understood and what they have to offer
should be harnessed for the sake of all the millions of out-of-school children that the
government school system is still not able to cover if the goal of Education for All is to
be achieved.",1

325,"Government and parents are both responsible for this. Even educated parents, these days don't spend much time with the children. They prefer to brainwash child's mind with mobiles and gadgets from early age so that they can focus on some other aspects of daily life and prefer to admit children in expensive schools, assuming that private school will take overall responsibility of their children's over all physical, mental and intellectual development.

All of these can be minimized to even zero, if parents try to become their child's friend and teacher, motivating and inspiring the child. Plus government schools can also provide high quality of education equivalent to what is being provided in recent so called A+ graded schools, but the problem is government is lagging behind in formulating effective policies and vision despite know the issues with public schools. 

We have seen children  from public school becoming doctors, engineers and other high level officers, but we can't find children of politicians studying in public school.",1

Meta analysis 1 

A Meta-Analysis on the Effects and Contributions of Public,
Public Charter, and Religious Schools on Student Outcomes
Abstract: 
An extensive meta-analysis, including 90 studies, was undertaken on the effects of religious private
schools, charter schools, and public schools. The study explores the relationship between each of
these school types and student outcomes. Additional analyses were done to determine the strengths
and weaknesses of these institutions in a broad sense. The results indicate that attending private
religious schools is associated with the highest level of academic achievement among the three
school types, even when sophisticated controls are used to adjust for socioeconomic status. Students
from public charter schools, however, performed no better than their counterparts in other public
schools. Supplementary analyses indicate several ways that educators from religious and public
schools can learn from one another.

Meta analysis 2 

Comparing Public, Private, and Market Schools:
The International Evidence
Abstract: 
Would large-scale, free-market reforms improve educational outcomes for American children? This question cannot be reliably
answered by looking exclusively at domestic evidence, much less
by looking exclusively at existing “school choice” programs.
Though many such programs have been implemented around the
United States, none has created a truly free and competitive education marketplace, being too small, too restriction laden, or both.
To understand how genuine market forces affect school performance, we must cast a wider net, surveying education systems
from all over the globe. The present paper undertakes such a
review, assessing the results of decades of international research
comparing market and government provision of education and
explaining why these international experiences are relevant to the
United States. In more than 150 statistical comparisons covering
eight different educational outcomes, the private sector outperforms the public sector in the overwhelming majority of cases.
Moreover, this margin of superiority is greatest when the freest and
most market-like private schools are compared to the least open
and least competitive government systems (i.e., those resembling
typical U.S. public school systems). Given the breadth, consistency,
relevance, and decisiveness of this body of evidence, the implications for U.S. education policy are significant.

Meta analysis of randomized controlled trials  provide the most reliable evidence on the effectiveness of interventions 

The participant effects of private school vouchers around the
globe: a meta-analytic and systematic review

ABSTRACT
School voucher programs are scholarship initiatives – frequently
government funded or incentivized – that pay for students to
attend private schools of their choice. This study is the first
formal meta-analytic consolidation of the evidence from all
randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating the student-level
math and reading test score effects of school vouchers
internationally. Our search process turned up 9,443 potential
studies, 21 of which were ultimately included. These 21 studies
represent 11 different voucher programs. Utilizing a random
effects and robust variance estimation framework, we find
moderate evidence of positive achievement impacts of private
school vouchers, with substantial effect heterogeneity across
programs and outcome years. Suggestive evidence exists that
voucher interventions may be cost effective even for null
achievement impacts. Future experimental studies of long-term,
scaled up voucher interventions could strengthen our
understanding of achievement impacts.",1

Parents are the one who have the highest motivation to make their kid educated, not you. There are school which are not expensive ani which are quite affordable and it attracts 1000s of student every year. For example there are parents who removed their kids from private school and sent them to SAMATA school which is literally made of bamboos, because they were able to provide quality education. Private schools are already doing their jobs, they are creating the educated citizens of the country, rather than going after them, why don't you think of better solution to improve the public school? did any parents asked you to make a video complaining about private school? if both parties are happy, why do you care? even if they pay for swimming pools, big buildings.
