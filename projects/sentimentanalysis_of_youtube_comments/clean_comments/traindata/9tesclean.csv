26,"I would also recommend for ""public-funded election"" and prohibit private or corporate funding that could hurt the public interest. 
So, how will it work? 
Firstly, any candidate who has won a local election (through private funding) is eligible (or any member of the legislative assembly) to compete in the provincial election with public funding. Any member of the legislative assembly is eligible to compete and receive public funding for the federal parliament.  
This would limit random people who intend to become MP through private funding or misuse public-funded elections. 

The second step is to decrease the size of Parliamentarians in Nepal. A province of the population of Karnali in the US sends 5 Congressmen and Bagmati province sends 8 Congressmen, even the largest US state via California sends 55 Congressmen. Bagmati alone sends around 63 MPs to the center- this makes the parliament tooooo unstable and we know how many unstable the Nepali parliament really is. With a smaller parliament- the public-funded election will also have a less economic constraint. 

Third, empower direct democracy- via the politicians are more of policy developers and not masters of parliament because what they build they will be forced to come to people for approval- Corporates will have little incentive to even fund politicians as they are incompetent to implement the exploitative policies of industries.  

Then there won't be party workers and Politicians will no longer be masters of the country but just government servants winning not through cash of corporates but directly by the ability to campaign with an equal amount of money allocated to each candidate.",0,would also recommend publicfunded election prohibit private corporate funding could hurt public interest work firstly candidate local election private funding eligible member legislative assembly compete provincial election public funding member legislative assembly eligible compete receive public funding federal parliament would limit random people intend become mp private funding misuse publicfunded election second step decrease size parliamentarian nepal province population karnali u send 5 congressman bagmati province send 8 congressman even large u state via california send 55 congressman bagmati alone send around 63 mp center make parliament tooooo unstable know many unstable nepali parliament really small parliament publicfunded election also less economic constraint third empower direct democracy via politician policy developer master parliament build force come people approval corporates little incentive even fund politician incompetent implement exploitative policy industry wont party worker politician longer master country government servant win cash corporates directly ability campaign equal amount money allocate candidate

 I) only those with the means are able to run for elections, which implies that competent aspirants without a vast treasury at their disposal won't be able to adequately run or campaign for their cause.

II) politicians are grossly exceeding the permitted limit, which implies that they're using black money to fund their campaign.

How can we solve the issue?

Here's my suggestion, we should make it so that candidates are not allowed to fund their campaign whatsoever, which creates an equal playing field and does not allow candidates to spend more than is necessary, obviously other caveates will have to be implemented, such as candidates are not allowed to spend more than a certain amount before elections and all expenditure before the elections must be declared and money used only for necessities (food, healthcare etc.) How can one promote their cause?  Well there are ways to do it for free, but this is the only solution that I see, but what about other commenters? What are ur criticisms and suggestions?",0,thought okay need tackle two problem mean able run election imply competent aspirant without vast treasury disposal wont able adequately run campaign cause ii politician grossly exceed permit limit implies theyre use black money fund campaign solve issue heres suggestion make candidate allow fund campaign whatsoever create equal playing field allow candidate spend necessary obviously caveates implemented candidate allow spend certain amount election expenditure election must declare money use necessity food healthcare etc one promote cause well way free solution see commenters ur criticism suggestion
