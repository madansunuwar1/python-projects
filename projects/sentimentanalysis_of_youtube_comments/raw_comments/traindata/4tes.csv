0,"दुर्लभ क्लिपहरू खोजेर राम्रो प्रस्तुति सहित भिडियो बनाउनु भएको रहेछ। त्यसका लागि धन्यवाद। मेरो आफ्नै अनुसन्धान पनि यी विषय ओरीपरि नै घुमेकोले यो भिडियोमा चाहिँ केही महत्त्वपूर्ण विषयहरू छुटेका रहेछन् भन्ने लाग्यो। जस्तै:        
 
१- भिडियोमा भनिएजस्तै कटवाल एकदम महत्त्वाकाङ्क्षी त थिए नै उनलाई नेपालमा भइरहेको राजनैतिक परिवर्तन पटक्कै मन परेको थिएन। जङ्गी अड्डामा बसेर उनले अनेक (अ)राजनैतिक क्रियाकलाप गरिरहेका थिए। मधेसी समुदायलाई पनि सेनामा प्रवेश दिने सरकारको तयारीको उनले विरोध गरेका थिए। अन्तरिम संविधानमा के-के राख्नु पर्छ र पर्दैन भनेर सरकारलाई लिस्ट नै पठाइदिएका थिए। एक जना माओवादी सेना पनि नेपाली सेनामा समायोजन गर्नुहुन्न भन्ने कटवालको अति अनुदार मत थियो। 

२- अप्रिल २००९ मा रिटायर हुनै लागेका आठ जना बिग्रेडियर जनरलहरुलाई म्याद थप्न कटवालले प्रस्ताव गरेका थिए। उनीहरूको म्याद थप्नु वा नथप्नु सरकारको पूर्ण अधिकारको विषय थियो। सरकारले म्याद नथपेपछि उनले ती जनरलहरूलाई जन निर्वाचित सरकारको निर्णय मान्न बाध्य गराउनुको साटो 'सरकारको निर्णयको मतलब नगरी काममा फर्कनु' भनेर 'थमौती' दिएका थिए। जुन आफैँमा गर्न नहुने काम थियो।

३- रामबहादुर थापा 'बादल' रक्षामन्त्री भैसकेपछि उनले सम्बन्ध सुधार्न केही प्रयास गरेका थिए, तर त्यो सफल हुन सकेन। पछि उनले रक्षा मन्त्रीको रूपमा कटवाललाई स्पष्टीकरण पनि सोधे। तर कटवालले त्यो स्पष्टीकरणको जवाफ कहिल्यै फर्काएनन्। माओवादी नेतृत्वको त्यो सरकारलाई कटवालले कुनै टेरपुछर नलाएको घटनाक्रमले देखाउँछ। 

४- जब प्रचण्ड सरकारले कटवाललाई बर्खास्त गर्ने निर्णय गर्‍यो, सोझो बाटो त सर्वोच्च अदालत जानु हुन्थ्यो, तर कटवालले त्यसो गरेनन्। उनले जंगिअड्डाबाट भारततिर र अन्य विदेशी शक्तिकेन्द्रतिर सम्पर्क गर्न थाले (जुन उनले आफ्नो आत्मकथा मै स्वीकार गरेका छन्।) कटवालको माओवादी विरोधी छवि भारतलाई पहिलेदेखि नै मन परेको थियो। ०६४ सालपछि जसरी माओवादीहरू नेपालको राजनीतिमा पहिलो शक्तिको रूपमा उदाएका थिए, त्यो भारतलाई रुचिरहेको थिएन। पहिलो शक्ति बनेपछि माओवादीहरूको पनि अति आत्मविश्वास र महत्त्वाकाङ्क्षी चरित्र प्रकट भएको थियो। सेनापति प्रकरणमार्फत माओवादीलाई 'सबक' सिकाउने अवसर भारतले प्राप्त गरेको थियो, जसको उसले भरपुर प्रयोग गर्‍यो। 

५- त्यो बेलाका भारतीय सेना प्रमुख कटवालका सहपाठी थिए र भारतीय राज्य संयन्त्रसंग उनको राम्रो उठबस थियो। भारतकै आडमा कटवालले नेपाली सरकारको उपेक्षा गरेका थिए। जब प्रचण्डले कटवाललाई बर्खास्त गरे, नेपालका लागि भारतीय राजदूत राकेश सुद ले २४ घण्टामा २ चोटि राष्ट्रपति यादवलाई भेटेर त्यो निर्णय खारेज गर्न दबाब दिएका थिए। त्यो बेलाका भारतीय बिदेशमन्त्री प्रणव मुखर्जीले त राष्ट्रपति यादवलाई फोन गरेरै कटवालको बर्खास्तकीको निर्णय राष्ट्रपतिले सदर गरे पनि कटवालले कुनै हालतमा जंगिअड्डा छोडेर नहिँड्ने धम्की दिएका थिए भनेर भनिन्छ। सन् २०१७ मा दिएको एक अन्तर्वार्तामा पूर्व राष्ट्रपति यादव भन्छन्:  ""एउटा विदेशी शक्तिले मलाई जनरल कटवाललाई स्टे अर्डर दिने र देशमा सङ्कटकाल घोषणा पनि गरोस् भन्ने चाहन्थे। तर, मैले सङ्कटकाल घोषणा गर्न अस्वीकार गरेँ।"" 

६- माओवादीहरू कटवाललाई बर्खास्त गरेर नेपालमा अधिनायकवाद लागु गर्न चाहन्छन् भनेर जुन भाष्य निर्माण गरियो, त्यसमा पनि खासै सत्यता छैन। काँग्रेस, एमालेजस्ता पार्टीहरू, नेपाली सेनाको त्यत्रो शक्ति र प्रतिकुल विदेशी परिवेशका बिच प्रचण्डको अधिनायकवाद ५ दिन पनि टिक्दैन भन्ने प्रचण्डलाई थाहा नहुने कुरा थिएन। २४० वर्षको राजतन्त्र फालेको १ वर्षमा नेपाली जनताले माओवादी अधिनायकवाद स्वीकार गर्थे भनेर सोच्नु पनि हास्यास्पद हो। माओवादीले पक्कै पनि सेना समायोजन गर्दा आफ्ना केही धेरै लडाकुहरू घुसाउन सक्थ्यो, तर त्यो भन्दा बढि खासै केही हुन्थ्यो जस्तो चाहिँ लाग्दैन। अधिनायकवाद लाद्ने प्रयास गरेको भए कहिले नउठ्ने गरि माओवादीहरु नै सिद्दिन्थे।   

७- कटवालको व्यापक असहयोगका बाबाजुत पनि प्रचण्डले उनलाई ३-४ महिना थप झेलेको भए कटवाल त रिटायर हुन्थे नै, प्रचण्डको सरकार पनि बच्थ्यो। संवैधानिक रूपमा सही भए पनि व्यवहारिक र राजनैतिक रूपमा प्रचण्डको त्यो काँचो निर्णय थियो।  कटवाललाई जसरी पनि हटाउनुपर्छ भन्नेमा त्यो बेलाको माओवादी पार्टीमा अलिक हार्डलाइनर मानिने मोहन वैद्य 'किरण', नेत्र विक्रम चन्द 'विप्लव', र रामबहादुर थापा 'बादल' लगायत थिए।",1

28,"In war, opposite side always does whatever necessary to win. We know the story of Great War Mahabharat. Its important to do duty/Karma and fight for what your believe
Whatever political ideology you have, you cannot deny Chief Katawal stood-up and did his duty whole heartedly and with passion. Chief Rookmangud Katwal is in his 80s and struggling to maintain his health. Prayers for his good health and peaceful retired life. 

As long as Nepal is between India and China, And foreign actor with vested interested have agenda for Nepal, there will only be change in character, story will be same. There will always be power struggle and you will have your heroes and villian to choose from.

133,"In my opinion, if Parchanda did what he want then Nepal would have be like China rule or Dictator rule. And Parchanda la weapon pickup ni garteya na hola because, he accomplished what he want and he became a top tire politician and the people who have been supporting Parchanda in civil war most of them won't support and they don't want to kill each other again. And I think that's the reason Parchanda didn't pickup weapon again. Army chief was also ready to take the worst scenario to fight back.",1
134,WE NEED OUR GREATER NEPAL 🇳🇵🇳🇵🇳🇵,1
135,Great content...,1
136,I still remember this day when Prachanda tried to fire the Army Chief. Our High School had to close in the middle of the day when this incident happened..........,1

138,"Army should always be under the government's control, it shouldn't have autonomy.",1
139,"I guess Army and king, both were on the side of Maoists because some of the witness have said that Army were loosing the battles, knowingly. APF were seen fighting and winning easily with Maoists and they were under the PM.",1
