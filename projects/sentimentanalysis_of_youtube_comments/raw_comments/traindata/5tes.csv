0,Thank you everyone for showing such  unexpected love & thanks to   the nepali comment team,1
1,"I m a newar from Bhaktapur. We were totally unaware from the problems facing by our brothers and sisters facing in madhes. CK Raut was also portrait as a villain by the media and political parties.
But through this video my perspective have totally change. All nepali should unit for a better and prosperous future of Nepal. Jay Nepal",1
2,"This video has changed my perception towards CK Raut, actually he’s not a bad person as he was shown by the media and other political parties. Thank you The Nepali Comment, you deserve more  limelight. All the best",1
3,"you are right. Most of us in terai consider ourselves Nepali. we were born in this land, we grew up the same way as the Kids in Pahad did, hearing stories of Prithvi Narayan shah, about all the dynasties that ever existed in Nepal and the development they did, about Gorkhalis and how our country never held back and stayed free. But we didn't feel the same as Kids of Pahad, unless we have ample amount of money. If you are from terai, you will not the get an item in a tourist shop at that cheap amount some Pahadi does. Why? cause you are from terai, so you are not Nepali, you are Inidan. But my whole life when I was in terai I never felt like any other country's citizen but Nepal. So, why did that women in that shop tell us that we are not Nepalis. What did we do? what did I do? since that day whenever we went outside terai, we lied that we are originally from Kathmandu just to get some discount and not to be treated like an outcast. 
when foreigners interview some people of Kathmandu or Lalitpur for their Youtube videos, they say that Nepal is a very peaceful country and there is no discrimination at all. But it's not the truth, they know it themselves. They might be that guy who didn't talk to a Madhesi student in their high school just because he was from terai. ( I am just thankful, this didn't happen with me but I have heard stories and trust me I have heard so many of them). There is fear among some people I know. IF and when you are in Kathmandu or outside terai you may not speak in Bhojpuri cause then people around you will know that you are a Madhesi and you simply don't want to be left out because you are human too. Some of them happen to hate their original identity so much that they lie about it (But our country is secular so I can't object on what you want to be called as), they are so consumed by the pride it brings them from hiding their identity that they look down upon their fellow Madhesi. 
The world has to stop lying that Nepal is indiscriminatory. IF we might have ever felt like we are not Nepali, its mostly because of the way we were treated. Despite everything I still call myself Nepali and a Madhesi and am proud. There might be some harsh people who treat us like an outcast but we can't ignore the fact that there are some nice people, who I came across in my life, who never cared about the title of Pahadi or Madeshi and  I love them and i am glad they exist.",1
4,"We grew up in a society where we were taught that madhesi people are like indian. They came from india. Thus, they are indian. And we believed it so. But since the protest about declarations of madhesh to a new country happened ,it made me think about the reason and when I came to know this caused because of the discrimination that we do to them, it changed my perspective towards them. Thanks for the video. Keep it up!",1
5,As a Kathmandu native I can never completely understand depth of Racism in Nepal. But I can somewhat understand pov of Dr. CK Raut.,1
6,"Damn, His story is truly inspiring!",1
7,Being madhesi you will face racism at some point of life especially  when you live in ktm.i can understand  the feelings   of his.The growth of his life journey  is markable.Huge respect to him.I hope this will bring change in Madhesh.,1
8,"This is the real story what every Nepalese should know about Dr. CK Raut , till this date he is misunderstood by alot of people, Hope this video will give them clarity.",1

13,Tough time creates strong men and he is the special one .,1
14,"Being a neutral of all politics I may say  his struggle as a boy from small village to  a scientist appointed in America must be a tough journey. This man have balls to change the future of Nepal. 
But it's pity Nepalese don't want a intellectual leader. 
I wish for his success ️",1

16,"The way he said ""Madhes ko Nepali"" was Awesome.
thank you Bro for this balanced words.",1
17,"We like to brag so much, Nepal is a tolerant and peaceful country with no discrimination. I am a young girl from Janakpur, and I can assure that there are many levels of discrimination in this country. They just make you feel inferior, even if they don't speak, you can see it in their eyes being treated as ""second class citizens"". This truly needs to stop. I am a proud Nepali and nobody can thief my identity 🇳🇵",1
18,"Totally explains about actual Dr. CK raut, No one explains like that, it help to spread positivity about Dr.ck raut bcz most of peoples of Nepal don’t know what he actually wants to do for madhesh.

His history is truly inspiring
Jay Nepal jay Madhesh",1

25,Thank you for enlightening us about CK RAUT ...so inspiring story,1
26,"Having been born and brought up as a Madheshi in Kathmandu, I can say that the discrimination and inequality is for real. By being called names such as ‘dhoti’, ‘marsia’, ‘bhelle’ and what not, people from Madhesh don’t get equal treatment be it in jobs, or anywhere for that matter. It is high time that the voices of people from Madhesh get heard and the attitude towards them changes for the good.",1
27,"We all are equal according to the constitution of our nepal
Jay Nepal Jay Madhesh🇳🇵🇳🇵",1
28,Didn't know he is also an engineer and yah such a inspiring and motivating story.,1

30,Huge respect for showing the reality️️,1
31,"Very well compiled , pure unbiased and researched  
 .Thank you for floating the dark truth around that has been suppressed & submerged as a result of racism and double standards of our own .Madhesi are equally  Nepali . The very soon it gets acknowledged ,else we will be scarehunted with same Separatist agenda time and again in the future for their mere identity ; which is nothing precious to ask , it's basic and fundamental right of people of Madhesh to live with dignity by being virtue of a Nepali citizen .
Thanks again ",1
32,never judge a book by its cover another good lesson,1
33,"Mob mentality is such a big problem in this world, prominently in Nepal. As much as we would like to think Nepalese are such good people, the reality paints a horrible picture of discrimination and societal chaos. I know there are absolute treasures in this country, but there are so many monsters in the form of people here as well. I never understood why such a turmoil was created in the first place when I first heard of it. I remember feeling distraught at having people wanting to break away from their identity from Nepal. But now I know. I know sheeps in this country made those discriminated feel like they had to be represented differently. It is what it is. The only way it can be remedied is getting their trust back and reminding those following the mob why secularity is a treasured identity in this country.",1
34,"He's voicing concerns what many other ethnic group of Nepal have struggled to do so. Identity crisis where one feels alienated in one own birth country, can't be worse than anything a person may experience in his lifetime.  So hats off to this guy for standing up on behalf of all Madhesi minorities subject  to suppression  by the leftist agenda.",1

Dukkha tw teiti kher hunthiyo jab  nepali huda pni Indian ko tag dine but nowadays everyone gets equally right.  ratio of  discrimination has decreased, tar purna rup le samadhan vayeko xaina #Jay_Nepal_Jay Madhesh",1

78,"Wowww  Wowww..... what a well researched ,  eye opening, unbiased heart touching , unknown truthfull video of TRUE warrior!!! ... my whole perspective changed now about Dr Ck Raut!... I m with him too... stop racism n discrimination!",1
79,"I thought CK Raut was villain due to media influence of course, but this video has changed my perspective. At the end of the day we all have to agree that there is discrimination against madhesi people and one way we can solve it is by changing ourselves on personal level and treating our friends and colleague from Mahesh like one of us.",1
80,"Great,keep it up bro  
We fight for discrimination",1
81,Never knew he was & is a legend ,1
82,"It is very unlikely for an under developed and poor nation like Nepal to make and enforce such programs and rules that could end the discrimination that lies amongst its people. Mass awareness campaigns with complete overhaul of education system is crucial to end any kind of discrimination or prejudice. Even after such awareness govt will need to prepare upliftment programs like quota system and prioritization schemes and inbuilt them in most of its activities (which actually is getting more unpopular in Nepal nowadays). The sheer amount of capital and human resource which the government will have to input in such programs is almost a dream in the current economic scenario. Even the richest of countries have been unable to completely eradicate discrimination amongst its people, so to expect a complete change in the nepali community within a few years or decades is foolishness. 

However the demand of equality and equal behavior is crucial now then ever. And the achievement of this goal is more in the hands of people than the government. We, as people need to change ourselves in this context, and the saying ""If You Want To Change The World, Start With Yourself First"" is most applicable here.",1
83,"Nice video and nice moral, whoever we are and wherever we are from, we are nepali and we all are one",1
84,"Thank you Thank you and Thank you so much of entire team of The Nepali Comment for making this beautiful content , Dr zCK Raut is the Real Hero and Legend of The Nation and Madhesh,  Love you Dr Ck Raut and please don't stop now , God bless you , Osho Bless you",1

92,"Ck raut always in our heart

93,"""Nepal jogauna Madhesh nabhae garo xa."" He is a knowledgeable guy always talks with logic & we need change and stroger part of Nepal.",1
94,"Madhesh Movement, Tharu movement , Adibasi Janajati Movement happened for reason. There is more than 100 ethnicities, culture and languages in Nepal. At some point these people felt suppressed, unheard and suffocated in their own nation. Equal distribution of service, rights, opportunity and identity recognition is important in heterogeneous society.
A lot has changed and improved in new constitution but there is still a vaccum and questions that are not answered. Nepal is not ready for another civil war and cannot handle any movement. Unbiased intellectuals should come forward and fill those vaccums. Loud doesn't mean right.  We as a Nepalese need to listen each other and must understand the challanges of multi - cultured  society.",1

101,Great content ,1
102,What an analysis ! Great 100 out of 100,1
103,"My take on Mr Ck Raut about his whole Madesh region to be separated and declared as a different nation is very smart move. The frustration and judgement which people from Madesh got was way too much for him to withstand and initially he rallied upon such a controversial topic to which people certainly craved upon. 
C'mon, realistically we know Nepal and the term ""Bisect"" will never come along and for a man with such a creative and intelligent mind he was very ahead in context of everything. He came, disputed, made his name on front page, people scratched, understood his agenda and today he is where he wanted to be.",1

109,"I remember those days clearly when Hritik Roshan rumors was there that he doesn't like Nepali. I was in Class 1 reading in Nepal model academy which was in Kapan. Our home was in Baghbazar and we were rushed to Home from mid school and had to walk all the narrow paths. She really provided us all the security for so many child. The school teacher really did a nice job to leave almost every child to their home. Those memory are vivd and like photos in my mind. And I have to say, I dont like Nepali either... Blessed land with cursed peoples..",1

Why? cause you are from terai, so you are not Nepali, you are Inidan. But my whole life when I was in terai I never felt like any other country's citizen but Nepal. So, why did that women in that shop tell us that we are not Nepalis. What did we do? what did I do? since that day whenever we went outside terai, we lied that we are originally from Kathmandu just to get some discount and not to be treated like an outcast. 
when foreigners interview some people of Kathmandu or Lalitpur for their Youtube videos, they say that Nepal is a very peaceful country and there is no discrimination at all. But it's not the truth, they know it themselves. They might be that guy who didn't talk to a Madhesi student in their high school just because he was from terai. ( I am just thankful, this didn't happen with me but I have heard stories and trust me I have heard so many of them). There is fear among some people I know. IF and when you are in Kathmandu or outside terai you may not speak in Bhojpuri cause then people around you will know that you are a Madhesi and you simply don't want to be left out because you are human too. Some of them happen to hate their original identity so much that they lie about it (But our country is secular so I can't object on what you want to be called as), they are so consumed by the pride it brings them from hiding their identity that they look down upon their fellow Madhesi. 
The world has to stop lying that Nepal is indiscriminatory. IF we might have ever felt like we are not Nepali, its mostly because of the way we were treated. Despite everything I still call myself Nepali and a Madhesi and am proud. There might be some harsh people who treat us like an outcast but we can't ignore the fact that there are some nice people, who I came across in my life, who never cared about the title of Pahadi or Madeshi and  I love them and i am glad they exist",1

204,CK Raut was misunderstood by us .,1
205,"@thenepalicomment, I higly appreciate your perception regarding this issue. It has been a pleasure listening someone with same perception as mine.

I would be grateful to hear your perception and to see your efforts to bring the truth of Resham Chaudhary  as well on the table. It would be a cherry on the cake if you mention the baisness in releasing report of Lal Aayog and the history of abuse and harassment of Nepal Police and other bureaucrats to the rural tharu and the backfire seen in Kailali incident.",1
206,"There is also a flip side of the coin. While you emphasised on incidents i.e. Hritik Roshan Riots and other populist movements in Terai/Madhesh but on a hind sight (while this could be outside of the scope for this particular video), the plight of Pahadiya people who lived on Madhesh are greatly ignored. The Mass killing/Massacre of Pahadiya people (at least 36 died) that occured in Kapilvastu followed up after after the killing of Moin Khan (2007) is one such an incident which is quite disturbing and so is Gaur incident (29 dead) which happened in March 2007, these incidents have damaged the social fabric of Nepal.",1

208,Great video. Tara malai jahan samma lagchha Rhitik Roshan le “Nepal ra Nepali man pardaina” bhaneko thiyena. I think he said something along the line of “I feel like I am still in India” when he was in Nepal implying that he felt at home while there.,1

241,"this is the first time, the problems of madesh and madeshi people are addressed ,
the scenario would not be so disturbing if madeshi people were considered as Nepali taraww as per most of the people of Kathmandu, madeshi haru taa Indian ho,
I can feel the mental trauma and dominance that madeshi students go through everyday in their classes and School in Kathmandu.",1
242,CK Raut was fighting for the right of Madheshis. After seeing a lot of discrimonation against Madheshi he thought Madheshi will not get their complete rights with pahadis. So he had no other option but to make Madhesh a separate country. If the Madheshis still  get treated as before another CK Raut will rise.,1
243,good information about Dr.CK Raut sir,1
244,Yea he is the true leader of  the madhesh️people,1

264,"It's not only about madhesh. It's about  People in rural hilly areas also. They haven't seen vehicle till now, they do not have quota as madhesh they don't have fertile land as madhesh, they don't have any facility like madhesh any but they never talked about division of Nepal. Why he want to divide the country. I don't like the idea of dividing the nation. Going to jail many time during protest, writing books, leaving lucrative job in America, not having even 1500 rupees to pay his admission doesn't make him great. He is not only one who have done struggle. If Nepal loses her madhesh fertile land then what will other Nepali will eat. If he is really fighting for equality he should fight for all poor of country not for the madhesh. Madhesh is the unseparable part of Nepal
. We all are Nepali we shouldn't entitle ourselves as madheshsi or pahadi. It is great to fight against the discrimination inequality and for honor of madhesh but Dividing madhesh..... it's just selfish, non ideal movement lead by a cruel and selfish person. So I don't like him.",1

This video should entice people with short term memory with general lack of social and political awareness.,1
281,Revealing and Informative.,1
282,"Being from a Pahade Community, Can I talk about the RACISM I faced during my stay in one of the biggest cities of Nepal in Terai? People with majority always look down upon minority ones. I along with my office colleagues faced an unspoken racism at our workplace just because the executive member was CALLED GHONGI during his college days. what about the racism we face once we are in madhesi majority place? you need to respect other to get respect.",1
283,Raytheon is not only a research institute its also a leading weapon designer and manufacturer of USA.,1
284,No doubt about racial discrimination faced by our Madhesi people. We (esp young generation) should end this in every aspect. One thing I could never understand about Madhesi leader is their preference for Hindi language. I don’t think people in Madhesh speak Hindi as their primary language. I myself worked in remote villages of Sarlahi and travelled few other nearby districts. I could never get things done speaking Hindi. Honestly local would not understand Hindi.,1
285,Wow to much deep study about ck raut... Gajab,1
286,"C K Raut isn't the best but is not also the worst, one thing I didn't like about him is he played a big role on trying to divide the nation rather than trying to fix the misunderstanding between pahadi and madeshi that's a red flag . Also if CK Raut had succeeded dividing the nation India will surely be involve into making it's new state with all the schemes it can do",1

Minor n local community are still left. Women and children are just a tool till now. Poverty and injustice taking big shape than ever before. We have to be shameful being nepalese among other countries because of our leadership. With that logic, i support him as true nepali. It make sense to be separate himal  and madhesh from nepal.  Gd luck to ck raut. He has potential to break the taboo.",1
297,He is Best️i follow him️,1
298,"Yeah, there is quite a big problems regarding Madhesi people accused of being Indian and face major discrimination. But Madhesh has the majority of agricultural lands. So, if Madhesh became new country, then remaining Nepal would fall very soon.",1
299,He is my pulchowk campus colleague. He might have got racial abuse by city dwellers and Newars who say “marsya” to people from Terai and  “pakhe” to people from hills. Racial injustice is a fact of Nepali society. This must be corrected:,1

307,"Wow! This is one biased take.. I used to respect you and your coverage before now.. You are putting a man whose main issue was secession of madesh from Nepal in a pedistal and worshipping him. Yes, The issue of identity of Madhesis should be solved but secession is not the solution. If you look at his  manifesto  from earlier days, the secession talk is his primary point, not a seconday point like you implied. He should never have been given any position of power. I really hope Nepal recovers form this mis step.",1
308,"What I like about this channel is how unbiased the presenter is. Not everyone covers the two sides of any topic.

All I have heard about Madeshi people from my parents is that they are traitors, disgusting, and not originally Nepali, and they always talk about their rights without doing their duties. I'll be honest, even I hated them. For years, I distanced myself from them. It was until I started fighting with one of them that I was suspended for a week from school and my teacher especially arranged my seating with that boy I fought. I finally talked to him, started with an apology then moved on to a random topic. He is and still is to this day my best friend. 

For me, racism and discrimination originate within your home because that is any child's first school. If you corrupt their young mind then that will be with them throughout their life. Nothing can convince them to change later in their lives. So, you should be careful about what you discuss in front of your children. If you want to burn the roots of racism, burn it within yourself.",1

1) Independent Madhesh cannot survive economically
2) There will be no way Madhesh will remain independent...India will annex it..that's why India wants a single Madhesh autonomous state with right to secede...which is unacceptable to Nepalis..

Also...would like to point out there is huge discrimination within Madhesi community...from upper caste Madhesis to dalits and lower class Madhesis...This thing CK Raut doesn't talk about...He doesn't want independent Madhesh..He wants to annex Madhesh to India...",1

368,"You know I am proud madheshi...
I can rise in my foot",1
369,"Really dissapointed with you on this one brother. Makes me question if this video was made in good faith. Such a rosy and positive framing of CK Raut makes ordinary Nepali feel as if he was done wrong by our governments, and it makes him to be an innocent victim in all this affair. You can not deny that fact that his movement was secessionist, and do you realize what laws around the world do to a leader of such seperatist movement? The most severe punishments are handed out to the guys like Mr CK Raut all over the world. 
Him being highly intelligent has no bearings in this discussion.  Ask yourself this question, does it matter if a gunman trying to shoot you in the head is a noble prize winner in physics? No, right? That gunman is still a gunman and that shot will still kill you, does not matter if it was triggered by the most intelligent person on earth, or by a chowk ko  Rame/Shyame.
Next, if you did not have an angle in making this content, you would have asked yourself this question, even when the charges were so severe, we are talking about a literal seperatist movement leader, why was he repeatedly let out of prison, no matter how many times he may get arrested? Who was that powerful entity that was throwing their weight behind him so that Nepali officials never dared to press any serious charges against him, or even when there were charges,  our judges would acquit him when what he was doing was clearly treason against the country? Why were these foreign NGOs so active to throw their weight behind him? Why would he address the public, not in their mother tongue like Maithili, Bhojpuri, etc. but in hindi? There are literally hundreds of questions you could have(and should have) asked yourself before making this content. If this was due to negligence, then that would be understandable, but if it was intentional, then I don't know how to feel about this/you as a content creater.
Now, me saying all this should not imply that I am in any way against Madeshi Nepali people, or their cause. I would always support their fight for recognition, better opportunities, and dignity among other things. This CK Raut guy is clever. He knows that there is a great resentment in Madhesi Nepali people against the establishment in Kathmandu, he uses that discontentment to further his own notorious aims. He does not have the best interest of ordinary Madhesi Nepali folks in mind, he is just another foreign puppet who would gladly burn his own country and his people if that means he comes out on top in the end. Sadly, he and his backers behind the scene, seem to have succeeded in fooling the general populace.",1

Yes, I am telling... We're not nationalist & we'll never be. The country that does not give full rights and representation in every sector for certain class of prople, then that is discrimination.

413,You have done a very surfacial research on him.. I live in terai and I don't see any discrimination...you know madeshis themselves are racist and have a very strong racial hierarchy. They discriminate pahadis more and inside heart they really feel closer to people across the border than the natives castes and people of Nepal...so yes the Inner thought is represented by ck raut so he is very popular... They do want to leave Nepal and build a separate state and I think Nepal government should allow them to leave and not be an obstacle to their agenda...otherwise whole life they will only fight for representation as if people from terai especially saptari siraha and birgunj are not in high position in Nepali companies and government. We can never please them and they will always make issue of representation,1

We can see that due to the societal chaos and discrimination pakistan departed from the India and the Bangladesh from Pakistan... Sometimes it's better to learn from others mistakes. So we must consider the reason behind the departion of our neighbouring countries.. 
And if the people of terai want they can be separated from Nepal and neighbor country India would help coz according to UNO if a particular region of country wants the freedom from their own nation due to such chaos they the neighbor nation might help themm 

That is what happened in Ukraine in 2014 when Russia declared its two states as two different countries. 
Once terai departs from nepal then there won't be any nation named  'NEPAL' in the world..",1

611,"Please stop identity politics in Nepal. I am a bahun. My father was brought up in miserable conditions due to early death of his father. He was married at 13 with my mother. My mother sold milk and agro products to educate my father with a hope that someday education will give them a hope to live. Indeed, Educating my father was a great step and has helped my family sustain in this new world. But, I grew up in unimaginable racism for being a Bahun that has shaped almost every aspect of my life. Nonetheless, I can understand that a lack of education is a cause for people to act unreasonably towards me. Lets not forget that Madesh is a place where innocent women are beaten till death just by accusing them as witches. Innocent brides are beaten and burnt alive for not being able to get the dowry. Women and children are thrown in brick furnaces alive for not following the same political agenda. Many people are just lost without anyone knowing there whereabouts. People are concerned about all of Nepal being overshadowed by this darkness which I would say is not just prevalent in Madesh, but all around Nepal where there is lack of education. Dalits are being made dalits to be able to secure that vote which can be achieved by just a couple of dollars. What about freeing the Dalits who have themselves accepted them as Dalits to get involved in identity politics? What about the sukumbasis who themselves term them as sukumbasis? What about the adibasi janajiti? Just research on the different types of identities that people hold in Nepal. A hero from Madesh who was tipped 1500 through a campain by the Madhesis looks like a small story. I wonder how many people with how many different identities have gotten through their lives in Nepal with a tip of more that just 1500 rupees from a person from a different identity? So, please stop creating chaos in Nepal and get a bit of education so that you can at least be reasonable and understand that you are just a human being.",1

I don't think he is hero but he is inspiring. People who are born in Nepal are nepali and people should not spread hate towards any ethnic group. 
Also Dr CK tried to spread his agenda at  very unstable times of our nation. I think he should have focused on equality if his issue was equality . Maybe to get more attention he did what he did which i respect but i still have mixed opinion. Also its sad that our government and justice system is a joke.",1

Manche educated hudai ma thik hunxa vani hudina.
Intelligence and desh prem is different thing. 
One question if he want to stand for madeshi then why didnt he ask for equality and what he did to end hater between madeshi and hilly region people. Did he every try to find root cause of hater and try to solve it. Withinternet knowledge and research naya desh ko theory dinu is not big deal. As u said he is engineer with talent. But jo manche le afu lai gareko discrimination lai revenge lina use garxa. That person is not country lover. He just want to vent out angry. He is not nice person. He could used his intelligence in study. He waste his talent and life just for revenge. 
One question k madesh ma ck raut le girl/women la equal right dina sakxa. What he is going to do against illegal entry of indian ppl by saying relative of madeshi ppl. Child marriage . Open crime. 
Most important what he going to do about open border with indian. India le sima michni activity ko against k garxa. 
Equality and respect should be earned. In past dherai incidents le garda equality vaena hola but so what that doesn't mean he can say such thing. If anybody support him then support for women to have different nation too. Because madeshi vanda euta women discrimination ko sikar hunxa .",1

To be arrested is another step for publicity. Besides all this, i believe he is just a puppet of some foreign nation like many other politicians.
