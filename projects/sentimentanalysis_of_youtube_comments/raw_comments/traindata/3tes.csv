37,"यो राज्यको पुरानो तर उदयमान मुद्दा र आन्दोलनका बिषय उठान/रिपोर्टिङ गरिदिनुभएकोमा दि नेपाली कमेन्टलाई विशेष धन्यवाद; म यसै आन्दोलनबाट निर्मित 'किसान मजदुर संघर्ष समिति'को सहयोगी/कमान्डर।
उक्त रिपोर्टमा किसान गाउँ फर्किसके र अहिलेको हाल थाहा नभएको बताइएको छ यद्यपि यहि भिडियो अपलोड गरिएको दिन संघर्ष समितीका प्रतिनिधि किसान सहित हामी केन्द्रिय कार्यलय सुस्ता देखि काठमाडौं आएका थियौँ।
कार्यदलको वर्तमान रिपोर्टिङ बुझ्नुका साथसाथै प्रधानमन्त्री कहाँ गएर निर्माणाधीन कानुन बिच अदालती प्रक्रिया रोक्न माग गरेका थियौँ र हिजो मात्र किसानहरु गाउँ फर्किनु भएको थियो।
यो समस्या मिटर ब्याज मात्र नभइ सिँगो राज्यको आर्थिक प्रणालीसँग जोडिएको बिषय हो। यो उदाउँदो राष्ट्रिय आन्दोलन पनि हो। केही प्रतिनिधिमुलक सुचना भएपनी केही गम्भीर कुराहरु जनतामाझ अझै प्रष्टाउन पाए निकै फलदायी हुनेथियो।
यस महत्त्वपूर्ण च्यानलका संचालकज्यु सँग केही कुरा गर्न पाउँछु भन्ने हार्दिक अपेक्षा सहित पुनः धन्यावाद भन्न चाहान्छु।

113,"Actually meter byaji ain't that wrong but the intention may be.
During an emergency, my dad took a loan of 3 lakh but the actual paper was made of 9 lakh. He was afraid of being scammed but as there wasn't any option he took the risk. Fortunately, the money owner had good intention and he didn't asked for a single extra penny of money after 1.5 year of return. The interest was high but it isn't the matter of concern because it's obvious that it would be if someone want that huge amount of money suddenly. So some of them do this just for their security and not having the intention of scamming.
But as there are many people suffering from this system, government must have to find some better alternative for both of them.",1
114,Good documentry..,1
115,"This is really sad to hear. But do you know why merchants charge 20-30  percent interest. Because the people who takes money are always bad with the money. In my village there is a family who hardly has 2 room house. Her complete property is less/small  than my Living room. 
And she took 8 lakh loan for her daughter marriage.  Do you think it's wise for the people to take that big loan when hardly what they afford is food in the plate. If the interest rate is low they will take even more loan and inflate the society. 
We have almost 10-11 percent inflation in our country. If someone lends someone in less than 10 percent their money becomes bad loan.  it's impossible to give someone loan in less than 20 percent.",1
