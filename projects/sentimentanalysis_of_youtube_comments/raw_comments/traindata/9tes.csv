5,"Thank you for your effort and shedding light to these topics. Making more contents like this will definitely add up to building a good nation. Change does not happen by whispering.

7,"Hello,
It would be interesting if you could research on the architect 'Gunadharma' of the largest buddhist stupa/temple of the world 'Borobudur' and it's design based on Mandala. Studies show that he was one of the greatest architect from Nepal.

9,"Hello Dipesh, I have something important to share with you. I have written a short essay on "" How can Rabi Lamichhane win the Premiership in this very election. If you are interested in making a video on that, please message me as soon as possible since the elections are very close. I would be very happy to share that with you. If people can be informed about that, perhaps we can have a different political reality going forward than it has been for the last many decades.",1

15,The real question is: Imagine how much the winning candidate earns since they are willing to invest this amount of money for a chance to win! That is the REAL question!!!,1

24,amazing and thoughtful insights ... Thank you for this amazing content... love to see more.,1
25,"Beautifully presented. 
Thank you for all you do. <3 <3 <3",1
26,"I would also recommend for ""public-funded election"" and prohibit private or corporate funding that could hurt the public interest. 
So, how will it work? 
Firstly, any candidate who has won a local election (through private funding) is eligible (or any member of the legislative assembly) to compete in the provincial election with public funding. Any member of the legislative assembly is eligible to compete and receive public funding for the federal parliament.  
This would limit random people who intend to become MP through private funding or misuse public-funded elections. 

The second step is to decrease the size of Parliamentarians in Nepal. A province of the population of Karnali in the US sends 5 Congressmen and Bagmati province sends 8 Congressmen, even the largest US state via California sends 55 Congressmen. Bagmati alone sends around 63 MPs to the center- this makes the parliament tooooo unstable and we know how many unstable the Nepali parliament really is. With a smaller parliament- the public-funded election will also have a less economic constraint. 

Third, empower direct democracy- via the politicians are more of policy developers and not masters of parliament because what they build they will be forced to come to people for approval- Corporates will have little incentive to even fund politicians as they are incompetent to implement the exploitative policies of industries.  

Then there won't be party workers and Politicians will no longer be masters of the country but just government servants winning not through cash of corporates but directly by the ability to campaign with an equal amount of money allocated to each candidate.",1

48,"Thoughts: okay, we need to tackle two problems:
 I) only those with the means are able to run for elections, which implies that competent aspirants without a vast treasury at their disposal won't be able to adequately run or campaign for their cause.

II) politicians are grossly exceeding the permitted limit, which implies that they're using black money to fund their campaign.

How can we solve the issue?

Here's my suggestion, we should make it so that candidates are not allowed to fund their campaign whatsoever, which creates an equal playing field and does not allow candidates to spend more than is necessary, obviously other caveates will have to be implemented, such as candidates are not allowed to spend more than a certain amount before elections and all expenditure before the elections must be declared and money used only for necessities (food, healthcare etc.) How can one promote their cause?  Well there are ways to do it for free, but this is the only solution that I see, but what about other commenters? What are ur criticisms and suggestions?",1
