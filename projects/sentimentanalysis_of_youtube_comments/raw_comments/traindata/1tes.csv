6,"It is believed that Shastri was executed more for his work in social reform and efforts to develop his mother tongue Nepal Bhasa than his involvement in politics. This is an important point and you should have touched on this, especially when many youths today are still brainwashed by such rulers' one-nation, one-language, one-dress, one-culture policy. It would have been a real justice to him as a martyr.",1
