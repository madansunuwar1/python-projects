0,"Hats off to the entire team  Going through piles and piles of book, resources, papers and others to make such a precise form into a short video with all the important facts and information is not an easy task. Being in this industry, it feels sad to use imported goods and serve the local market for existence.",
1,My mom raised me by working on Garment factory..so I have a good memories inside the factory with the childs of other workers ,
2,Nepal was a leading country in material industries.. its just sad seeing where we have come from then! Political instabillity le desh lai ekdam pachi parya xa.. hopefully good days come.. Ô∏è Keep up the contents bro.,
3,Disclaimer: this channel is highly addictive ,
4,My dad owned a garment factory during that time. Used to feel so proud seeing our products were gonna be worn by foreigners. 500 workers were employed in our factory. But when the industry collapsed it hit all of our homes hard.,
5,"I never knew we had such a early head start in a garment industry but unfortunately our nation politics killed most of our industry, i just hope we can recover from this anyways thanks a lot for making this video, you are great ",
6,"Even my mom used to work for such garment industry in Biratnagar, but in 2010 AD because of political donations & load shedding they shifted the factory to India",
7,"Was garment industry the only industry in Nepal?What about other industries? 
Wasn't it the Indian geopolitics that destroyed the Nepali industry market by buying out the industries but not running them like  biratnagar jute mill , Gorkhali rubber ? 
Can you cover the video how the Biratnagar jute mill and Gorkhali tires failed ?",
8,"Informative as always!!
I do remember two Garment industries at Hattiban, Lalitpur during my childhood days. The roads used to be flooded with crowd of people during office hours.",
9,I remember garments factory next to our house while growing up. There were so many small factories in our neighborhood in 90s.,
10,The seaport is a must-have for the garment industry. Nepal should demand a corridor through India to Bangladeshi ports. Many industries can be revived by this.,
11,This channel has always give a positive message to the Nepalese who doesn't know the history of Nepal üá≥üáµüá≥üáµ,
12,"Loved the video bro , you must now be consistent , many of us are too addictive towards your channel that we watch your video many times , Hope you will try to upload video quiet fast

13,What an indepth research and a balanced take. Hats off!,
14,We used to own hotel near one of those factory where a lot of Nepali and Indian workers used to work ‚Ä¶ we had steady income during that booming phase later when it hit decline we all had difficulty maintaining income ..,
15,"The subject you choose to speak is spot on. It is what has made this channel growing fast, i presume. 
Can you please make a video on chaotic road plan and housing in kathmandu?",
16,My dream industry since childhood Ô∏è,
17,The fact that Nepal dont have sea port for sea route is the major drawback for international business and thats the bitter truth why we couldnt expand in international much.... international market might want nepali manpower but no product,
18,"I come from Gaindakot, Nawalparasi, where numerous garment industries thrived when I was a child. These industries provided thousands of local people with employment opportunities and enabled them to earn decent wages without having to seek work in Gulf countries. It was common for at least one member of a family to be employed in these factories. It is unfortunate that these factories began shutting down, leading to job losses for many people. The Maoist conflict set the country back by 50 years, which is truly regrettable and unfortunate.",
