राइट टु रिजेक्ट अप्सन हुन निक्कै नै जरूरी छ, कसैले त यो विषयमा दमदार तरिका ले आवाज उठाउनु पर्यो ,  युवा हरु घटाइदैन छन्।वृद्ध र  बच्चा हरु बढ्दैछन् मेन पावर को कमी हुँदैछ अब samayyy धेरै कम छ आउने 10 वर्ष भोट नेपाल लाई जसरी पनि बिजनेस, फ्याक्ट्री, एक्सपोर्ट सेक्टर हरुमा हरेक क्षेत्रमा देभलप हुन जरुरी छ, नत्र पछी विश्वकै राम्रो नेता नै आएपनि नेपाली लाई गरिबी को चपेटा मा जान  बाट कसैले बचाउन सक्दै । 
आउने मंसिर मा जसरी पनि चोर घुसखोर बुढो हरु पार्टी र तिनी हरुको पार्टी लाई हटाउनै पर्यो मात्र देशले निक्कै नै खतरनाक मोड लिने छ अहिले पनि समय छ झोले न बनौ  आउने पुस्ताको जिन्दगी बर्बाद न गरौं। अब नयाँ  युवा लाई मौका दिनु पर्यो ।",1

83,"Two other major problems: 
1. Voting right of Nepalese migrant workers or living abroad still with Nepali citizenship

86,"Could you also shed some light on the mass exodus of skilled manpower, like doctors, engineers, nurses, etc. ? Also how the Nepal government is willingly propagating this exodus of youth abroad, just so they can get a taste of that ""remittance tax"".. 
 
P.S. Nepal is going to face a huge shortage of doctors and nurses in the coming 5-8 years. Even, reputed and established doctors are flocking abroad..... all the while, the policy makers do nothing to encourage the retention of this skilled man-power... Sahujis and influential doctors are themselves the policy makers and make policies that helps them gain their personal benefits....",1
