3,"you are right. Most of us in terai consider ourselves Nepali. we were born in this land, we grew up the same way as the Kids in Pahad did, hearing stories of Prithvi Narayan shah, about all the dynasties that ever existed in Nepal and the development they did, about Gorkhalis and how our country never held back and stayed free. But we didn't feel the same as Kids of Pahad, unless we have ample amount of money. If you are from terai, you will not the get an item in a tourist shop at that cheap amount some Pahadi does. Why? cause you are from terai, so you are not Nepali, you are Inidan. But my whole life when I was in terai I never felt like any other country's citizen but Nepal. So, why did that women in that shop tell us that we are not Nepalis. What did we do? what did I do? since that day whenever we went outside terai, we lied that we are originally from Kathmandu just to get some discount and not to be treated like an outcast. 
when foreigners interview some people of Kathmandu or Lalitpur for their Youtube videos, they say that Nepal is a very peaceful country and there is no discrimination at all. But it's not the truth, they know it themselves. They might be that guy who didn't talk to a Madhesi student in their high school just because he was from terai. ( I am just thankful, this didn't happen with me but I have heard stories and trust me I have heard so many of them). There is fear among some people I know. IF and when you are in Kathmandu or outside terai you may not speak in Bhojpuri cause then people around you will know that you are a Madhesi and you simply don't want to be left out because you are human too. Some of them happen to hate their original identity so much that they lie about it (But our country is secular so I can't object on what you want to be called as), they are so consumed by the pride it brings them from hiding their identity that they look down upon their fellow Madhesi. 
The world has to stop lying that Nepal is indiscriminatory. IF we might have ever felt like we are not Nepali, its mostly because of the way we were treated. Despite everything I still call myself Nepali and a Madhesi and am proud. There might be some harsh people who treat us like an outcast but we can't ignore the fact that there are some nice people, who I came across in my life, who never cared about the title of Pahadi or Madeshi and  I love them and i am glad they exist.",0,right u terai consider nepali born land grow way kid pahad hear story prithvi narayan shah dynasty ever exist nepal development gorkhalis country never hold back stayed free didnt feel kid pahad unless ample amount money terai get item tourist shop cheap amount pahadi cause terai nepali inidan whole life terai never felt like country citizen nepal woman shop tell u nepalis since day whenever go outside terai lie originally kathmandu get discount treat like outcast foreigner interview people kathmandu lalitpur youtube video say nepal peaceful country discrimination truth know might guy didnt talk madhesi student high school terai thankful didnt happen heard story trust heard many fear among people know kathmandu outside terai may speak bhojpuri cause people around know madhesi simply dont want leave human happen hate original identity much lie country secular cant object want call consume pride brings hide identity look upon fellow madhesi world stop lie nepal indiscriminatory might ever felt like nepali mostly way treat despite everything still call nepali madhesi proud might harsh people treat u like outcast cant ignore fact nice people come across life never care title pahadi madeshi love glad exist

I know there are absolute treasures in this country, but there are so many monsters in the form of people here as well. I never understood why such a turmoil was created in the first place when I first heard of it. I remember feeling distraught at having people wanting to break away from their identity from Nepal. But now I know. I know sheeps in this country made those discriminated feel like they had to be represented differently. It is what it is.

82,"It is very unlikely for an under developed and poor nation like Nepal to make and enforce such programs and rules that could end the discrimination that lies amongst its people. Mass awareness campaigns with complete overhaul of education system is crucial to end any kind of discrimination or prejudice. Even after such awareness govt will need to prepare upliftment programs like quota system and prioritization schemes and inbuilt them in most of its activities (which actually is getting more unpopular in Nepal nowadays). The sheer amount of capital and human resource which the government will have to input in such programs is almost a dream in the current economic scenario. Even the richest of countries have been unable to completely eradicate discrimination amongst its people, so to expect a complete change in the nepali community within a few years or decades is foolishness. 

However the demand of equality and equal behavior is crucial now then ever. And the achievement of this goal is more in the hands of people than the government. We, as people need to change ourselves in this context, and the saying ""If You Want To Change The World, Start With Yourself First"" is most applicable here.",1,unlikely developed poor nation like nepal make enforce program rule could end discrimination lie amongst people mass awareness campaign complete overhaul education system crucial end kind discrimination prejudice even awareness govt need prepare upliftment program like quota system prioritization scheme inbuilt activity actually get unpopular nepal nowadays sheer amount capital human resource government input program almost dream current economic scenario even rich country unable completely eradicate discrimination amongst people expect complete change nepali community within year decade foolishness however demand equality equal behavior crucial ever achievement goal hand people government people need change context say want change world start first applicable

199,"You are right. Most of us in terai consider ourselves Nepali. we were born in this land, we grew up the same way as the Kids in Pahad did, hearing stories of Prithvi Narayan shah, about all the dynasties that ever existed in Nepal and the development they did, about Gorkhalis and how our country never held back and stayed free. But we didn't feel the same as Kids of Pahad, unless we have ample amount of money. If you are from terai, you will not the get an item in a tourist shop at that cheap amount some Pahadi does. Why? cause you are from terai, so you are not Nepali, you are Inidan. But my whole life when I was in terai I never felt like any other country's citizen but Nepal. So, why did that women in that shop tell us that we are not Nepalis. What did we do? what did I do? since that day whenever we went outside terai, we lied that we are originally from Kathmandu just to get some discount and not to be treated like an outcast. 
when foreigners interview some people of Kathmandu or Lalitpur for their Youtube videos, they say that Nepal is a very peaceful country and there is no discrimination at all. But it's not the truth, they know it themselves. They might be that guy who didn't talk to a Madhesi student in their high school just because he was from terai. ( I am just thankful, this didn't happen with me but I have heard stories and trust me I have heard so many of them). There is fear among some people I know. IF and when you are in Kathmandu or outside terai you may not speak in Bhojpuri cause then people around you will know that you are a Madhesi and you simply don't want to be left out because you are human too. Some of them happen to hate their original identity so much that they lie about it (But our country is secular so I can't object on what you want to be called as), they are so consumed by the pride it brings them from hiding their identity that they look down upon their fellow Madhesi. 
The world has to stop lying that Nepal is indiscriminatory. IF we might have ever felt like we are not Nepali, its mostly because of the way we were treated. Despite everything I still call myself Nepali and a Madhesi and am proud. There might be some harsh people who treat us like an outcast but we can't ignore the fact that there are some nice people, who I came across in my life, who never cared about the title of Pahadi or Madeshi and  I love them and i am glad they exist",0,right u terai consider nepali born land grow way kid pahad hear story prithvi narayan shah dynasty ever exist nepal development gorkhalis country never hold back stayed free didnt feel kid pahad unless ample amount money terai get item tourist shop cheap amount pahadi cause terai nepali inidan whole life terai never felt like country citizen nepal woman shop tell u nepalis since day whenever go outside terai lie originally kathmandu get discount treat like outcast foreigner interview people kathmandu lalitpur youtube video say nepal peaceful country discrimination truth know might guy didnt talk madhesi student high school terai thankful didnt happen heard story trust heard many fear among people know kathmandu outside terai may speak bhojpuri cause people around know madhesi simply dont want leave human happen hate original identity much lie country secular cant object want call consume pride brings hide identity look upon fellow madhesi world stop lie nepal indiscriminatory might ever felt like nepali mostly way treat despite everything still call nepali madhesi proud might harsh people treat u like outcast cant ignore fact nice people come across life never care title pahadi madeshi love glad exist

For me, racism and discrimination originate within your home because that is any child's first school. If you corrupt their young mind then that will be with them throughout their life.

369,"Really dissapointed with you on this one brother. Makes me question if this video was made in good faith. Such a rosy and positive framing of CK Raut makes ordinary Nepali feel as if he was done wrong by our governments, and it makes him to be an innocent victim in all this affair. You can not deny that fact that his movement was secessionist, and do you realize what laws around the world do to a leader of such seperatist movement? The most severe punishments are handed out to the guys like Mr CK Raut all over the world. 
Him being highly intelligent has no bearings in this discussion.  Ask yourself this question, does it matter if a gunman trying to shoot you in the head is a noble prize winner in physics? No, right? That gunman is still a gunman and that shot will still kill you, does not matter if it was triggered by the most intelligent person on earth, or by a chowk ko  Rame/Shyame.
Next, if you did not have an angle in making this content, you would have asked yourself this question, even when the charges were so severe, we are talking about a literal seperatist movement leader, why was he repeatedly let out of prison, no matter how many times he may get arrested? Who was that powerful entity that was throwing their weight behind him so that Nepali officials never dared to press any serious charges against him, or even when there were charges,  our judges would acquit him when what he was doing was clearly treason against the country? Why were these foreign NGOs so active to throw their weight behind him? Why would he address the public, not in their mother tongue like Maithili, Bhojpuri, etc. but in hindi? There are literally hundreds of questions you could have(and should have) asked yourself before making this content. If this was due to negligence, then that would be understandable, but if it was intentional, then I don't know how to feel about this/you as a content creater.
Now, me saying all this should not imply that I am in any way against Madeshi Nepali people, or their cause. I would always support their fight for recognition, better opportunities, and dignity among other things. This CK Raut guy is clever.

And if the people of terai want they can be separated from Nepal and neighbor country India would help coz according to UNO if a particular region of country wants the freedom from their own nation due to such chaos they the neighbor nation might help themm 

That is what happened in Ukraine in 2014 when Russia declared its two states as two different countries.

My mother sold milk and agro products to educate my father with a hope that someday education will give them a hope to live. Indeed, Educating my father was a great step and has helped my family sustain in this new world. But, I grew up in unimaginable racism for being a Bahun that has shaped almost every aspect of my life. Nonetheless, I can understand that a lack of education is a cause for people to act unreasonably towards me. Lets not forget that Madesh is a place where innocent women are beaten till death just by accusing them as witches. Innocent brides are beaten and burnt alive for not being able to get the dowry. Women and children are thrown in brick furnaces alive for not following the same political agenda. Many people are just lost without anyone knowing there whereabouts. People are concerned about all of Nepal being overshadowed by this darkness which I would say is not just prevalent in Madesh, but all around Nepal where there is lack of education. Dalits are being made dalits to be able to secure that vote which can be achieved by just a couple of dollars. What about freeing the Dalits who have themselves accepted them as Dalits to get involved in identity politics? What about the sukumbasis who themselves term them as sukumbasis? What about the adibasi janajiti? Just research on the different types of identities that people hold in Nepal. A hero from Madesh who was tipped 1500 through a campain by the Madhesis looks like a small story. I wonder how many people with how many different identities have gotten through their lives in Nepal with a tip of more that just 1500 rupees from a person from a different identity?
