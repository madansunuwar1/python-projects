2,"I had never thought the real story of the same martyrs that we studied back in school was this interesting. I don't know how much you had to dig for the all the information you provided in this video, but I definitely feel like this video shows that you can make a whole series that highlight countless other topics otherwise relegated to the pages of dusty old history books no one cares to turn anymore. To me at least, it's always felt like the events and people of the past, the stories  we read in our social studies and history textbooks are but bygone tales in black and white with little to no relevance in the present day.
With so much western history adapted into numerous movies, TV series and informative animations, I had always wondered whether the dearth of such materials online in the case of Nepal was due genuinely to the unavailability of written records of our history, but through emerging channels like yours, I am beginning to think that we do, as a country, have enough information to produce massively consumable video content that has the potential to serve the public memory well. As time proves over and over, we are a people that could use some historical memory.
Great content! And your effort shows, we do notice the minor details as well, details that you could so easily have omitted without much to lose. Keep up the good work guys.",1,never think real story martyr study back school interesting dont know much dig information provide video definitely feel like video show make whole series highlight countless topic otherwise relegate page dusty old history book one care turn anymore least always felt like event people past story read social study history textbooks bygone tale black white little relevance present day much western history adapt numerous movie tv series informative animation always wonder whether dearth material online case nepal due genuinely unavailability write record history emerge channel like begin think country enough information produce massively consumable video content potential serve public memory well time prove people could use historical memory great content effort show notice minor detail well detail could easily omit without much lose keep good work guy

When we had to study them during 8th and 9th grade, we weren't interested at all cause what 13 year old would be, but now after finishing high school, it's so fascinating learning about how our country had its own Game of Thrones type of political intrigue and drama mixed together with strategic battles and scheming, murderous plots.

I mean reading about them is certainly more interesting than knowing the current political situation, at least for me.",1,imagine well make series prithivi narayan shahs unification campaign onset demise rana regime study 8th 9th grade werent interested cause 13 year old would finish high school fascinate learn country game throne type political intrigue drama mixed together strategic battle scheme murderous plot mean read certainly interest know current political situation least

200,"I hate how the Nepali History has been discrediting the sacrifice of their first ever Nepali martyr ""Lakhan Thapa Magar"". He is rarely even being talked about in the present Nepal, despite being renowned as the first martyr who stood up to Junga Bahadur Rana after retiring from the old Gorkha Paltan.

He was a part of the Nepali soldiers who assisted the British Army to brutally suppress Indian rebels who were fighting for the independence of India. This was around 1857/58 after the Meerut massacre which gave birth to a military revolution against the British colony in India.

All of these incidents led Lakhan Thapa Magar and other revolutionaries to fight against the tyrannical rule of Junga Bahadur Rana in Nepal also. By 1868/69 (1925 BS), Thapa had already been promoted as the captain of the Nepal Army. However, he left his job along with his friend Jai Singh Chumi Magar in order to unite the people against the rule of Jung Bahadur Rana.

With the help of the local people of his birthplace, Thapa built a strong fort there and also built a temple inside the fort. He used to unite the people coming there to worship and make them aware of the arbitrary rule of Junga Bahadur Rana and his anti-public acts.
As per the historian Padam Jung Rana, Thapa had gathered 1,500 people along with weapons and supplies to attack the Rana government. He wanted to end the rule of the Junga Bahadur Rana and to establish democracy in the country.
But, Junga Bahadur Rana got the information of the revolution led by Thapa. Subsequently, Lakhan Thapa and his associates were arrested from Bungkot and brought to Kathmandu. They were tortured all along their way.
And, it was decided that Lakhan Thapa and his associates would be hanged from the tree in front of the Manakamana temple of their fort premises in the presence of the local people at Bungkot, Gorkha. They were charged with treason.

After they did not beg a pardon in front of the Rana government, they were all brought to Gorkha. And, at first, the leader Lakhan Thapa was hanged from the tree in front of Manakamana temple inside his fort on February 14, 1877. It is also said that he has been skinned and hanged. And, after him, all other rebels were hanged.
11 days after his death, Junga Bahadur Rana also died in Borland, Gorkha.

He was the first Nepali to protest against the tyrannical Rana rule. Therefore, he was declared a martyr in 1999 by the Nepal government. And, the government declared him as the first martyr of Nepal on September 20, 2015.

Falgun 2nd (14th February) of every year is declared as 'Sahid Lakhan Thapa diwas' to commemorate his sacrifice for the nation and is declared holiday in some part of province 4 and 5.

 Such parts of the history must not be erased as it is tried to be done pretty much everytime something revolutionary happens.",0,hate nepali history discredit sacrifice first ever nepali martyr lakhan thapa magar rarely even talk present nepal despite renowned first martyr stand junga bahadur rana retire old gorkha paltan part nepali soldier assist british army brutally suppress indian rebel fight independence india around 185758 meerut massacre give birth military revolution british colony india incident lead lakhan thapa magar revolutionary fight tyrannical rule junga bahadur rana nepal also 186869 1925 b thapa already promote captain nepal army however leave job along friend jai singh chumi magar order unite people rule jung bahadur rana help local people birthplace thapa build strong fort also build temple inside fort use unite people come worship make aware arbitrary rule junga bahadur rana antipublic act per historian padam jung rana thapa gathered 1500 people along weapon supply attack rana government want end rule junga bahadur rana establish democracy country junga bahadur rana get information revolution lead thapa subsequently lakhan thapa associate arrest bungkot bring kathmandu torture along way decide lakhan thapa associate would hang tree front manakamana temple fort premise presence local people bungkot gorkha charge treason beg pardon front rana government bring gorkha first leader lakhan thapa hang tree front manakamana temple inside fort february 14 1877 also say skin hanged rebel hang 11 day death junga bahadur rana also die borland gorkha first nepali protest tyrannical rana rule therefore declare martyr 1999 nepal government government declare first martyr nepal september 20 2015 falgun 2nd 14th february every year declare sahid lakhan thapa diwas commemorate sacrifice nation declare holiday part province 4 5 part history must erase try do pretty much everytime something revolutionary happens
