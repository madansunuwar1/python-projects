0,Thank you everyone for such a great response. Just wanted to say that the English subtitles are available now.,1
1,"I arguably think that our country got way backward due to the Ranas. We can't even imagine what common people had faced at that time. And to stop that autocratic rule what our martyrs did are truly unreal.
Thank you for bringing us #Sahid haru ko katha
Uni haruko balidan kahile birsinexainau",1
2,"I had never thought the real story of the same martyrs that we studied back in school was this interesting. I don't know how much you had to dig for the all the information you provided in this video, but I definitely feel like this video shows that you can make a whole series that highlight countless other topics otherwise relegated to the pages of dusty old history books no one cares to turn anymore. To me at least, it's always felt like the events and people of the past, the stories  we read in our social studies and history textbooks are but bygone tales in black and white with little to no relevance in the present day.
With so much western history adapted into numerous movies, TV series and informative animations, I had always wondered whether the dearth of such materials online in the case of Nepal was due genuinely to the unavailability of written records of our history, but through emerging channels like yours, I am beginning to think that we do, as a country, have enough information to produce massively consumable video content that has the potential to serve the public memory well. As time proves over and over, we are a people that could use some historical memory.
Great content! And your effort shows, we do notice the minor details as well, details that you could so easily have omitted without much to lose. Keep up the good work guys.",1
3,Thanks Martyrs may making Nepal to this stage .,1
4,"Hug respect to Martyrs.
This kind of content should be made frequently so that we could get knowledge Ô∏è",1
5,Salute from the bottom of my heart to those legendary and brave Marty's,1
6,"Imagine we had a well made series about Prithivi Narayan Shah's unification campaign or the onset and demise of the Rana regime. When we had to study them during 8th and 9th grade, we weren't interested at all cause what 13 year old would be, but now after finishing high school, it's so fascinating learning about how our country had its own Game of Thrones type of political intrigue and drama mixed together with strategic battles and scheming, murderous plots.

I mean reading about them is certainly more interesting than knowing the current political situation, at least for me.",1
7,"Man was born free

200,"I hate how the Nepali History has been discrediting the sacrifice of their first ever Nepali martyr ""Lakhan Thapa Magar"". He is rarely even being talked about in the present Nepal, despite being renowned as the first martyr who stood up to Junga Bahadur Rana after retiring from the old Gorkha Paltan.

He was a part of the Nepali soldiers who assisted the British Army to brutally suppress Indian rebels who were fighting for the independence of India. This was around 1857/58 after the Meerut massacre which gave birth to a military revolution against the British colony in India.

All of these incidents led Lakhan Thapa Magar and other revolutionaries to fight against the tyrannical rule of Junga Bahadur Rana in Nepal also. By 1868/69 (1925 BS), Thapa had already been promoted as the captain of the Nepal Army. However, he left his job along with his friend Jai Singh Chumi Magar in order to unite the people against the rule of Jung Bahadur Rana.

With the help of the local people of his birthplace, Thapa built a strong fort there and also built a temple inside the fort. He used to unite the people coming there to worship and make them aware of the arbitrary rule of Junga Bahadur Rana and his anti-public acts.
As per the historian Padam Jung Rana, Thapa had gathered 1,500 people along with weapons and supplies to attack the Rana government. He wanted to end the rule of the Junga Bahadur Rana and to establish democracy in the country.
But, Junga Bahadur Rana got the information of the revolution led by Thapa. Subsequently, Lakhan Thapa and his associates were arrested from Bungkot and brought to Kathmandu. They were tortured all along their way.
And, it was decided that Lakhan Thapa and his associates would be hanged from the tree in front of the Manakamana temple of their fort premises in the presence of the local people at Bungkot, Gorkha. They were charged with treason.

After they did not beg a pardon in front of the Rana government, they were all brought to Gorkha. And, at first, the leader Lakhan Thapa was hanged from the tree in front of Manakamana temple inside his fort on February 14, 1877. It is also said that he has been skinned and hanged. And, after him, all other rebels were hanged.
11 days after his death, Junga Bahadur Rana also died in Borland, Gorkha.

He was the first Nepali to protest against the tyrannical Rana rule. Therefore, he was declared a martyr in 1999 by the Nepal government. And, the government declared him as the first martyr of Nepal on September 20, 2015.

Falgun 2nd (14th February) of every year is declared as 'Sahid Lakhan Thapa diwas' to commemorate his sacrifice for the nation and is declared holiday in some part of province 4 and 5.

 Such parts of the history must not be erased as it is tried to be done pretty much everytime something revolutionary happens.",1
