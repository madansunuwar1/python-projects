You need a serious boost. 
You have done so much with so little. 
Your team and you are doing commendable job. 
Investigative journalism in Nepal is in Comatose state with Dhamalisation being deadly prevalent. 
And ""Gham Ka paila haru"" gives some idea on the advent of Nepalese railway which hoped to connect into mid-hills a literary genius of Late Dha.Cha Gotame reverberates there.
